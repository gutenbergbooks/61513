<span class="larger">THE PHANTOM DEATH.</span></p>

<div class="smaller">

<p>“No other writer so effectually carries his readers down to the sea in ships, and
even in steamers he never fails to give us the true salt atmosphere.... ‘The
Lazarette of the Huntress’ is undoubtedly one of the most exciting tales ever written
by a past-master in the art of thrilling his readers, while the other ten yarns are all
thoroughly interesting.”—<span class="smcap">Manchester Courier.</span></p>

<p>“There is not one which is not entertaining, and many are positively thrilling.”—<span class="smcap">Sun.</span></p>

<p>“We can cordially recommend it as being, in its way, equal to anything that
Mr. Clark Russell has yet written. Higher praise than this could hardly be given
to a collection of stories.”—<span class="smcap">Speaker.</span></p>

<p>“There is plenty of variety, and all are as good reading as those which have
previously come from the same author’s pen.”—<span class="smcap">Scotsman.</span></p>

<p>“All full of adventure, and form capital reading.”—<span class="smcap">Lloyd’s Weekly News.</span></p>

<p>“A collection of thrilling tales of the sea from the ever-felicitous pen of Mr. Clark
Russell, the most inventive and picturesque of modern writers on maritime subjects....
In point of merit no distinction can be made between these stories, for they are
one and all absolutely first-class.”—<span class="smcap">Daily Telegraph.</span></p>

<p>“Marked by Mr. Clark Russell’s genius, in which the horrible, the grotesque, and
the humorous are well contrasted. No other writer so realises for us the moods of
the sea, or tells tales of the sea with such faithful and vivid presentation.”—<span class="smcap">Leeds
Mercury.</span></p>

<p>“All alike intensely interesting, and instinct with the life and motion of the ‘ever-changing,
never-changing sea.’”—<span class="smcap">Weekly Dispatch.</span></p>

<p>“One thing is certain about Mr. Clark Russell—whatever the story he has to tell,
he cannot write a page without imparting to it the briny savour of the sea. His
storms are impressive, his bright breezes are exhilarating, but his rendering of a dead
ocean calm is as unique as the thing itself. It is a master’s work.”—<span class="smcap">Academy.</span></p>

<p>“Mr. Russell keeps up a remarkable freshness of tone in his sea-stories.... These
stories vary a good deal in purport and incident, but they are all attractive and
ingenious.... Eleven half-hours of thoroughly diverting fiction.”—<span class="smcap">Athenæum.</span></p>

<p>“There is something picturesque, or weird, or sensational, in all of them.... All
are entertaining, all are especially suitable for readers in a hurry, or readers who want
something that will let thought be quiet.”—<span class="smcap">Bookman.</span></p>

<p>“The wonderful fertility of invention which we have once or twice referred to as
specially characteristic of Mr. Russell’s maritime novels is well in evidence in this
collection of stories. The best of them are really excellent, and even those which are
less good than the best stand on an exceptionally high level.”—<span class="smcap">Spectator.</span></p>

<p>“‘The Phantom Death’ has all the best characteristics of Mr. Russell’s style—stirring
plot, mastery of exact detail, and power of bringing each picture vividly before
the mind’s eye of the reader.”—<span class="smcap">St. Paul’s.</span></p>

<p>“All racy of the real sea, vigorously told, and exciting some admiration at the
fertility of the imagination which has contrived to create so many diverse sensational
incidents out of such similar materials without a single instance of repetition.”—<span class="smcap">Guardian.</span></p>

<h2 id="THE_PHANTOM_DEATH"><i>THE PHANTOM DEATH.</i></h2>

<p>On the 24th of April, 1840, having finished the business
that had carried me into the Brazils, I arrived at Rio
de Janeiro, where I found a vessel lying nearly loaded,
and sailing for the port of Bristol in four or five days.
In those times, passenger traffic between Great Britain
and the eastern coast of South America was almost
entirely carried on in small ships, averaging from 200
to 500 tons. The funnel of the ocean mail steamer,
with her gilded saloons and side wheels, which, to the
great admiration of all beholders, slapped twelve knots
an hour out of the composite fabric, had not yet hove
into sight above the horizon of commerce, and folks
were very well satisfied if they were no longer than
three months in reaching the Brazilian coast out of
the River Thames.</p>

<p>The little ship in which I took passage was a barque
called the <i>Lord of the Isles</i>; her burthen was something
under four hundred tons. She was a round-bowed
waggon of a vanished type, with a square, sawed-off
stern, painted ports, heavy over-hanging channels, and
as loftily rigged, I was going to say, as a line-of-battle-ship,
owing to her immense beam, which gave her the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
stability of a church. I applied to the agent and hired
a cabin, and found myself, to my secret satisfaction, the
only passenger in the ship. Yes, I was rejoiced to be
the sole passenger; my passage out had been rendered
memorably miserable by the society of as ill-conditioned,
bad-tempered, sulky a lot of wretches as ever turned in
of a night into bunks, and cursed the captain in their
gizzards in a calm for not being able to whistle a wind
up over the sea-line.</p>

<p>The name of the skipper of the <i>Lord of the Isles</i> was
Joyce. He was unlike the average run of the men in
that trade. Instead of being beef-faced and bow-legged,
humid of eye and gay with grog-blossoms, he was tall,
pale, spare; he spoke low and in a melancholy key;
he never swore; he drank wine and water, and there
was little or nothing in his language to suggest the
sailor. His berth was right aft on the starboard side;
mine was right aft also, next his. Three cabins on
either hand ran forward from these two after-berths.
Two of them were occupied by the first and second
mates. Between was a roomy “state-cabin,” as the
term then was: a plain interior furnished with an
oblong table and fixed chairs, lighted by day by a large
skylight, by night by a couple of brass lamps.</p>

<p>We sailed away on a Monday morning, as well I
recollect, out of the spacious and splendid scene of the
harbour of Rio, and under full breasts of canvas, swelling
to the height of a main-skysail big enough to serve as
a mizzen topgallant-sail for a thousand-ton ship of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
to-day, and with taut bowlines and yearning jibs, and
a heel of hull that washed a two-foot wide streak of
greenish copper through the wool-white swirl of froth
that broke from the bows, the <i>Lord of the Isles</i> headed
on a straight course for the deep solitudes of the
Atlantic.</p>

<p>All went well with us for several days. Our ship’s
company consisted of twelve men, including a boatswain
and carpenter. The forecastle hands appeared very
hearty, likely fellows, despite their pier-head raiment
of Scotch cap and broken small clothes, and open
flannel shirt, and greasy sheath-knife belted to the hip.
They worked with a will, they sang out cheerily at the
ropes, they went in and out of the galley at meal-time
without faces of loathing, and but one complaint came
aft before our wonderful, mysterious troubles began:
the ship’s bread crawled, they said, and, being found
truly very bad, good white flour was served out in lieu.</p>

<p>We had been eight days at sea, and in that time had
made fairly good way; it drew down a quiet, soft, black
night with the young moon gone soon after sunset, a
trembling flash of stars over the mastheads, a murky
dimness of heat and of stagnation all round about the
sea-line, and a frequent glance of sea-fire over the side
when a dip of the barque’s round bends drove the water
from her in a swelling cloud of ebony. I walked the
quarter-deck with the captain, and our talk was of
England and of the Brazils, and of his experiences as
a mariner of thirty years’ standing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>“What of the weather?” said I, as we came to
a pause at the binnacle, whose bright disc of illuminated
card touched into phantom outlines the hairy features
of the Jack who grasped the wheel.</p>

<p>“There’s a spell of quiet before us, I fear,” he
answered, in his melancholy, monotonous voice. “No
doubt a day will come, Mr. West, when the unhappy
sea-captain upon whose forehead the shipowner would
be glad to brand the words ‘Prompt Despatch’ will be
rendered by steam independent of that most capricious
of all things—wind. The wind bloweth as it listeth—which
is very well whilst it keeps all on blowing; for
with our machinery of trusses, and parrels, and braces,
we can snatch a sort of propulsion out of anything short
of hurricane antagonism within six points of what we
want to look up for. But of a dead night and of a
dead day, with the wind up and down, and your ship
showing her stern to the thirty-two points in a single
watch, what’s to be done with an owner’s request of
<em>look sharp</em>? Will you come below and have some
grog?”</p>

<p>The second mate, a man named Bonner, was in
charge of the deck. I followed the captain into the
cabin, where he smoked a cigar; he drank a little wine
and water, I drained a tumbler of cold brandy grog,
then stepped above for an hour of fresh air, and afterwards
to bed, six bells, eleven o’clock, striking as I
turned in.</p>

<p>I slept soundly, awoke at seven o’clock, and shortly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
afterwards went on deck. The watch were at work
washing down. The crystal brine flashed over the
white plank to the swing of the bucket in the boatswain’s
powerful grasp, and the air was filled with the
busy noise of scrubbing-brushes, and of the murmurs
of some live-stock under the long-boat. The morning
was a wide radiant scene of tropic sky and sea—afar,
right astern on the light blue verge, trembled the
mother-o’-pearl canvas of a ship; a small breeze was
blowing off the beam; from under the round bows of
the slightly-leaning barque came a pleasant, brook-like
sound of running waters—a soft shaling as of foam
over stones, sweet to the ear in that heat as the music
of a fountain. Mr. Bonner, the second mate, was again
in charge of the deck. When I passed through the
companion hatch I saw him standing abreast of the
skylight at the rail: the expression of his face was
grave and full of concern, and he seemed to watch the
movements of the men with an inattentive eye.</p>

<p>I bade him good morning; he made no reply for a
little, but looked at me fixedly, and then said, “I’m
afraid Captain Joyce is a dead man.”</p>

<p>“What is wrong with him?” I exclaimed eagerly,
and much startled.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, sir. I wish there was a medical
man on board. Perhaps you’d be able to tell what
he’s suffering from if you saw him.”</p>

<p>I at once went below, and found the lad who waited
upon us in the cabin preparing the table for breakfast.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
I asked him if the captain was alone. He answered
that Mr. Stroud, the chief mate, was with him. On
this I went to the door of Captain Joyce’s cabin and
lightly knocked. The mate looked out, and, seeing
who I was, told me in a soft voice to enter.</p>

<p>Captain Joyce lay in his bunk dressed in a flannel
shirt and a pair of white drill trousers. All his throat
and a considerable portion of his chest were exposed,
and his feet were naked. I looked at him scarcely
crediting my sight: I did not know him as the man I
had parted with but a few hours before. He was
swelled from head to foot as though drowned: the
swelling contorted his countenance out of all resemblance
to his familiar face; the flesh of him that was
visible was a pale blue, as if rubbed with a powder of
the stuff called “blue” which the laundresses use in
getting up their linen. His eyes were open, but the
pupils were rolled out of sight, and the “whites,” as
they are called, were covered with red blotches.</p>

<p>I had no knowledge of medicine, and could not
imagine what had come to the poor man. He was
unconscious, and evidently fast sinking. I said to Mr.
Stroud, “What is this?”</p>

<p>The mate answered, “I’m afraid he’s poisoned himself
accidentally. It looks to me like poison. Don’t
it seem so to you, sir? See how his fingers and toes
are curled.”</p>

<p>I ran my eye over the cabin and exclaimed, “Have
you searched for any bottles containing poison?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>“I did so when he sent for me at four o’clock, and
complained of feeling sick and ill. He was then changing
colour, and his face was losing its proper looks. I asked
him if he thought he had taken anything by mistake.
He answered no, unless he had done so in his sleep. He
awoke feeling very bad, and that was all he could tell
me.”</p>

<p>I touched the poor fellow’s hand, and found it cold.
His breathing was swift and thin. At moments a convulsion,
like a wrenching shudder, passed through him.</p>

<p>“Is it,” I asked, “some form of country sickness,
do you think—some kind of illness that was lying latent
in him when we sailed?”</p>

<p>“I never heard of any sort of sickness,” he answered,
“that made a man look like that—not cholera even.
And what but poison would do its work so quickly?
Depend upon it he’s either been poisoned, or poisoned
himself unawares.”</p>

<p>“Poisoned!” I exclaimed. “Who’s the man in this
ship that’s going to do such a thing?”</p>

<p>“It’s no natural illness,” he answered, looking at
the livid, bloated face of the dying man; and he repeated
with gloomy emphasis, “He’s either been poisoned, or
he’s poisoned himself unawares.”</p>

<p>I stood beside Mr. Stroud for about a quarter of an
hour, watching the captain and speculating upon the
cause of his mortal sickness; we talked in low voices,
often pausing and starting, for the convulsions of the
sufferer made us think that he had his mind and wished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
to sit up and speak; but the ghastly, horrid, vacant
look of his face continued fixed by the stubborn burial
of the pupils of his eyes; his lips moved only when his
frame was convulsed. I put my finger upon his pulse
and found the beat thread-like, terribly rapid, intermittent,
and faint. Then, feeling sick and scared, I
went on deck for some air.</p>

<p>The second mate asked me how the captain was and
what I thought. I answered that he might be dead
even now as I spoke; that I could not conceive the
nature of the malady that was killing him, that had
apparently fastened upon him in his sleep, and was
threatening to kill him within the compass of four or
five hours, but that Mr. Stroud believed he had been
poisoned, or had poisoned himself accidentally.</p>

<p>“Poisoned!” echoed the second mate, and he sent
a look in the direction of the ship’s galley. “What’s
he eaten that we haven’t partaken of? A regular case
of poisoning, does the chief officer think it? Oh no—oh
no—who’s to do it? The captain’s too well liked
to allow of such a guess as that. If the food’s
been fouled by the cook in error, how’s it that the
others of us who ate at the cabin table aren’t likewise
seized?”</p>

<p>There was no more to be said about it then, but in
less than half an hour’s time the mate came up and
told us the captain was gone.</p>

<p>“He never recovered his senses, never spoke except
to talk in delirium,” he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>“You think he was poisoned, sir?” said the second
mate.</p>

<p>“Not wilfully,” answered Mr. Stroud, looking at
me. “I never said that; nor is it a thing one wants
to think of,” he added, sending his gaze round the wide
scene of flashing ocean.</p>

<p>He then abruptly quitted us and walked to the
galley, where for some while he remained out of sight.
When he returned he told the second mate with whom
I had stood talking that he had spoken to the cook, and
thoroughly overhauled the dressing utensils, and was
satisfied that the galley had nothing to do with the
murderous mischief which had befallen the skipper.</p>

<p>“But why be so cock-certain, Mr. Stroud,” said I,
“that the captain’s dead of poisoning?”</p>

<p>“I <em>am</em> cock-certain,” he answered shortly, and with
some little passion. “Name me the illness that’s going
to kill a man in three or four hours, and make such a
corpse of him as lies in the captain’s cabin.”</p>

<p>He called to the second mate, and they paced the
deck together deep in talk. The men had come up
from breakfast, and the boatswain had set them to the
various jobs of the morning; but the news of the captain’s
death had gone forward; it was shocking by
reason of its suddenness. Then, again, the death of the
master of a ship lies cold and heavy upon the spirits of
a company at sea; ’tis the head gone, the thinking
part. The mate may make as good a captain, but he’s
not the man the crew signed articles under. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
seamen of the <i>Lord of the Isles</i> wore grave faces as
they went about their work; they spoke softly, and the
boatswain delivered his orders in subdued notes. After
a bit the second mate walked forward and addressed the
boatswain and some of the men, but what he said I did
not catch.</p>

<p>I breakfasted and returned on deck: it was then ten
o’clock. I found the main-topsail to the mast and a
number of seamen standing in the gangway, whilst the
two mates hung together on the quarter-deck, talking,
as though waiting. In a few minutes four seamen
brought the body of the captain up through the companion
hatch, and carried it to the gangway. The
corpse was stitched up in a hammock and rested upon
a plank, over which the English ensign was thrown. I
thought this funeral very hurried, and dreaded to think
that the poor man might be breathing and alive at the
instant of his launch, for after all we had but the
mate’s assurance that the captain was dead; and what
did Mr. Stroud know of death—that is, as it would be
indicated by the body of a man who had died from
some swift, subtle, nameless distemper, as Captain Joyce
seemingly had?</p>

<p>When the funeral was over, the topsail swung, and
the men returned to their work, I put the matter to the
mate, who answered that the corpse had turned black,
and that there could be no more question of his being
dead than of his now being overboard.</p>

<p>The breeze freshened that morning. At noon it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
was blowing strong, with a dark, hard sky of compacted
cloud, under which curls and shreds of yellow scud
fled like a scattering of smoke, and the mates were
unable to get an observation. Mr. Stroud seemed
engrossed by the sudden responsibilities which had
come upon him, and talked little. That afternoon he
shifted into the captain’s berth, being now, indeed, in
command of the barque. It was convenient to him to
live in that cabin, for the necessary nautical appliances
for navigating the ship were there along with facilities
for their use. Mr. Bonner told me that he and the
mate had thoroughly examined the cabin, overhauled
the captain’s boxes, lockers, shelves and the like for
anything of a poisonous nature, but had met with
nothing whatever. It was indeed an amazing mystery,
he said, and he was no longer of opinion with Mr.
Stroud that poison, accidentally or otherwise taken,
had destroyed the captain. Indeed, he now leaned to
my view, that Captain Joyce had fallen a victim to
some disease which had lain latent in him since leaving
Rio, something deadly quick and horribly transforming,
well known, maybe, to physicians of the Brazils, if,
indeed, it were peculiar to that country.</p>

<p>Well, three days passed, and nothing of any moment
happened. The wind drew ahead and braced our yards
fore and aft for us, and the tub of a barque went to leeward
like an empty cask, shouldering the head seas into
snowstorms off her heavy round bow, and furrowing a
short scope of oil-smooth wake almost at right angles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
with her sternpost. Though Mr. Stroud had charge of
the ship, he continued from this time to keep watch and
watch with Mr. Bonner as in the captain’s life, not
choosing, I dare say, to entrust the charge of the deck to
the boatswain. On the evening of this third day that I
have come to, I was sitting in the cabin under the lamp
writing down some memories of the past week in a diary,
when the door of the captain’s berth was opened, and
my name was faintly called. I saw Mr. Stroud, and
instantly went to him. His hands were clasped upon
his brow, and he swayed violently as though in pain,
with greater vehemence than the heave of the deck
warranted; his eyes were starting, and, by the clear
light of the brace of cabin lamps, I easily saw that his
complexion was unusually dusky, and darkening even,
so it seemed to me, as I looked.</p>

<p>I cried out, “What is the matter, Mr. Stroud?”</p>

<p>“Oh, my God!” he exclaimed, “I am in terrible
pain—I am horribly ill—I am dying.”</p>

<p>I grasped him by the arm and conducted him to his
bunk, into which he got, groaning and holding his head,
with an occasional strange short plunge of his feet such
as a swimmer makes when resting in the water on his
back. I asked him if he was only just now seized. He
answered that he was in a deep sleep, from which he
was awakened by a burning sensation throughout his
body. He lay quiet awhile, supposing it was a sudden
heat of the blood; but the fire increased, and with it
came torturing pains in the head, and attacks of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
convulsions; and even whilst he told me this the convulsive
fits grew upon him, and he broke off to groan
deeply as though in exquisite pain and distress of mind;
then he’d set his teeth, and then presently scream out,
“Oh, my God! I have been poisoned—I am dying!”</p>

<p>I was thunderstruck and terrified to the last degree.
What was this dreadful thing—this phantom death
that had come into the ship? Was it a contagious
plague? But what distemper is there that, catching
men in their sleep, swells and discolours them even as
the gaze rests upon them, and dismisses their souls to
God in the space of three or four hours?</p>

<p>I ran on deck, but waited until Mr. Bonner had
finished bawling out some orders to the men before
addressing him. The moon was young, but bright, and
she sheared scythe-like through the pouring shadows,
and the light of her made a marvellous brilliant whiteness
of the foam as it burst in masses from the plunge
of the barque’s bows. When I gave the news to Mr.
Bonner, he stared at me for some moments wildly and in
silence, and then rushed below. I followed him as
quick as he went, for I had often used the sea, and the
giddiest dance of a deck-plank was all one with the solid
earth to my accustomed feet. We entered the mate’s
berth, and Mr. Bonner lighted the bracket lamp and
stood looking at his shipmate, and by the aid of the
flame he had kindled, and the bright light flowing in
through the open door, I beheld a tragic and wonderful
change in Mr. Stroud, though scarce ten minutes had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
passed since I was with him. His face was bloated, the
features distorted, his eyes rolled continuously, and
frequent heavy twitching shudders convulsed his body.
But the most frightful part was the dusky hue of his
skin, that was of a darker blue than I had observed in
the captain.</p>

<p>He still had his senses, and repeated to the second
mate what he had related to me. But he presently
grew incoherent, then fell delirious, in about an hour’s
time was speechless and lay racked with convulsions;
of a horrid blue, the features shockingly convulsed, and
the whites of the eyes alone showing as in the captain’s
case.</p>

<p>He had called me at about nine o’clock, and he was
a dead man at two in the morning, or four bells in the
middle watch. Both the second mate and I were constantly
in and out with the poor fellow; but we could
do no good, only marvel, and murmur our astonishment
and speculations. We put the captain’s steward,
a young fellow, to watch him—this was an hour before
his death—and at four bells the lad came out with a
white face, and said to me, who sat at the table,
depressed and awed and overwhelmed by this second
ghastly and indeterminable visitation, that the chief
mate was dead, had ceased to breathe, and was quickly
turning black.</p>

<p>Mr. Bonner came into the cabin with the boatswain,
and they went into the dead man’s berth and stayed
there about a quarter of an hour. When they came out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
the boatswain looked at me hard. I recollect that that
man’s name was Matthews. I asked some questions,
but they had nothing to tell, except that the body had
turned black.</p>

<p>“What manner of disease can it be that kills in this
fashion?” said I. “If it’s the plague, we maybe all
dead men in a week.”</p>

<p>“It’s no plague,” said the boatswain, in a voice that
trembled with its own volume of sound.</p>

<p>“What is it?” I cried.</p>

<p>“Poison!” he shouted, and he dropped his clenched
fist with the weight of a cannon-ball upon the
table.</p>

<p>I looked at the second mate, who exclaimed, “The
boatswain swears to the signs. He’s seen the like of
that corpse in three English seamen who were poisoned
up at Chusan.”</p>

<p>“Do you want to make out that both men have
committed suicide?” I exclaimed.</p>

<p>“I want to make out that both men have been
poisoned!” shouted the boatswain, in his voice of
thunder.</p>

<p>There was a significance in the insolence of the
fellow that confounded and alarmed me, and the meaning
was deepened by the second mate allowing his
companion to address me in this roaring, affronting
way without reproof. I hoped that the man had been
drinking, and that the second mate was too stupid with
horror to heed his behaviour to me, and without giving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
either of them another word I walked to my cabin and
lay down.</p>

<p>I have no space here to describe the wild and terrifying
fancies which ran in my head. For some while I
heard the boatswain and the second mate conversing,
but the cabin bulkhead was stout, the straining and
washing noises all about the helm heavy and continuous,
and I caught not a syllable of what they said. At
what hour I fell asleep I cannot tell; when I awoke my
cabin was full of the sunshine that streamed in through
the stern window. I dressed, and took hold of the
handle of the door, and found myself a prisoner. Not
doubting I was locked up in error, I shook the door, and
beat upon it, and called out loudly to be released.
After a few minutes the door was opened, and the
second mate stood in the threshold. He exclaimed—</p>

<p>“Mr. West, it’s the wish of the men that you should
be locked up. I’m no party to the job—but they’re
resolved. I’ll tell you plainly what they think: they
believe you’ve had a hand in the death of the captain
and the chief mate—the bo’sun’s put that into their
heads; I’m the only navigator left, and they’re afraid
you’ll try your hand on me if you have your liberty.
You’ll be regularly fed and properly seen to; but it’s
the crew’s will that you stop here.”</p>

<p>With that, and without giving me time to utter a
word, he closed and secured the door. I leaned against
the bulkhead and sought to rally my wits, but I own
that for a long while I was as one whose mind comes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
slowly to him after he has been knocked down insensible.
I never for an instant supposed that the crew really
believed me guilty of poisoning the captain and chief
mate: I concluded that the men had mutinied, and
arranged with Mr. Bonner to run away with the ship,
and that I should remain locked up in my cabin until
they had decided what to do with me.</p>

<p>By-and-by the door was opened, and the young
steward put a tray containing some breakfast upon the
cabin deck. He was but a mule of a boy, and I guessed
that nothing but what might still further imperil me
could come of my questioning him, so in silence I
watched him put down the tray and depart. The meal
thus sent to me was plentiful, and I drew some small
heart out of the attention. Whilst I ate and drank, I
heard sounds in the adjoining berth, and presently
gathered that they were preparing the body of the chief
mate for its last toss over the side. After a bit they
went on deck with the corpse, and then all was still in
the cabin. I knew by the light of the sun that the
vessel was still heading on her course for England. It
was a bright morning, with a wild windy sparkle in as
much of the weather as I could see through the cabin
window. The plunge of the ship’s stern brought the
water in a roar of milky froth all about the counter
close under me, and the frequent jar of rudder and
jump of wheel assured me that the barque was travelling
fast through the seas.</p>

<p>What, in God’s name, did the men mean by keeping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
me a prisoner? Did they think me a madman? Or
that I, whose life together with theirs depended upon
the safe navigation of the barque, would destroy those
who alone could promise me security? And what had
slain the two men? If poison, who had administered
it? One man might have died by his own hand, but
not both. And since both had perished from the same
cause, self-murder was not to be thought of. What
was it, then, that had killed them, visiting them in
their sleep, and discolouring, bloating, convulsing, and
destroying them in a few hours? Was it some deadly
malady subtly lurking in the atmosphere of the after
part of the vessel? If so, then I might be the next to
be taken. Or was there some devilish murderer lying
secretly hidden? Or was one of the crew the doer of
these things? I seemed to smell disease and death,
and yearned for the freedom of the deck, and for the
sweetness of the wide, strong rush of wind.</p>

<p>The day passed. The second mate never visited me.
The lad arrived with my meals, and when he came
with my supper I asked him some questions, but
obtained no more news than that the second mate had
taken up his quarters in the adjoining berth as acting
captain, and that the boatswain was keeping watch and
watch with him.</p>

<p>I got but little rest that night. It blew hard, and
the pitching of the vessel was unusually heavy. Then,
again, I was profoundly agitated and in deep distress
of mind; for, supposing the men in earnest, it was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
only horrible to be thought capable of murder, there
was the prospect of my being charged and of having to
clear my character. Or, supposing the men’s suspicion
or accusation a villainous pretext, how would they serve
me? Would they send me adrift, or set me ashore to
perish on some barren coast, or destroy me out of hand?
You will remember that I am writing of an age when
seafaring was not as it now is. The pirate and the
slaver were still afloat doing a brisk business. There
often went a desperate spirit in ships’ forecastles, and
the maritime records of the time abound with tragic
narratives of revolt, seizure, cruelty of a ferocious sort.</p>

<p>Another day and another night went by, and I was
still locked up in my cabin, and, saving the punctual
arrival of the lad with my meals, no man visited me.</p>

<p>Some time about eight o’clock on the morning of
the third day of my confinement, I was looking through
the cabin window at the space of grey and foaming sea
and sallow flying sky which came and went in the
square of the aperture with the lift and fall of the
barque’s stern, when my cabin door was struck upon,
and in a minute afterwards opened, and the boatswain
appeared.</p>

<p>“Mr. West,” said he, after looking at me for a
moment in silence with a face whose expression was
made up of concern and fear and embarrassment, “I’ve
come on my own part, and on the part of the men, sir,
to ask your pardon for our treatment of you. We was
mistook. And our fears made us too willing to believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
that you had a hand in it. We dunno what it is now,
but as Jesus is my God, Mr. West, the second mate he
lies dead of the same thing in the next cabin!”</p>

<p>I went past him too stupefied to speak, and in a
blind way sat down at the cabin table and leaned my
head against my hand. Presently I looked up, and
on lifting my eyes I caught sight of two or three sailors
staring down with white faces through the skylight.</p>

<p>“You tell me that the second mate’s dead?” said I.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, dead of poison, too, so help me God!”
cried the boatswain.</p>

<p>“Who remains to navigate the ship?” I said.</p>

<p>“That’s it, sir!” he exclaimed, “unless you can
do it?”</p>

<p>“Not I. There’s no man amongst you more ignorant.
May I look at the body?”</p>

<p>He opened the door of the cabin in which the others
had died, and there, in the bunk from which the bodies
of Captain Joyce and Mr. Stroud had been removed,
lay now the blackened corpse of the second mate. It
was an awful sight and a passage of time horrible with
the mystery which charged it. I felt no rage at the
manner in which I had been used by that dead man
there and the hurricane-lunged seaman alongside of me
and the fellows forward; I could think of nothing but
the mystery of the three men’s deaths, the lamentable
plight we were all in through our wanting a navigator,
with the chance, moreover, that it <em>was</em> the plague, and
not poison mysteriously given, that had killed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
captain and mates, so that all the rest of us, as I have
said, might be dead men in another week.</p>

<p>I returned to the cabin, and the boatswain joined
me, and we stood beside the table conversing, anxiously
watched by several men who had stationed themselves
at the skylight.</p>

<p>“What we’ve got to do,” said I, “is to keep a bright
look-out for ships, and borrow some one to steer us
home from the first vessel that will lend us a navigator.
We’re bound to fall in with something soon. Meanwhile,
you’re a smart seaman yourself, Matthews, as
well qualified as any one of them who have died to sail
the ship, and there’s surely some intelligent sailor
amongst the crew who would relieve you in taking
charge of the deck. I’ll do all I can.”</p>

<p>“The question is, where’s the vessel now?” said
the boatswain.</p>

<p>“Fetch me the log-book,” said I, “and see if you
can find the chart they’ve been using to prick the
courses off on. We should be able to find out where
the ship was at noon yesterday. I can’t enter that
cabin. The sight of the poor fellow makes me sick.”</p>

<p>He went to the berth and passed through the door,
and might have left me about five minutes, evidently
hunting for the chart, when he suddenly rushed out,
roaring in his thunderous voice, “I’ve discovered it!
I’ve discovered it!” and fled like a madman up the
companion steps. I was startled almost to the very
stopping of my heart by this sudden furious wild<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
behaviour in him: then wondering what he meant by
shouting “he had discovered it!” I walked to the
cabin door, and the very first thing my eye lighted
upon was a small snake, leisurely coiling its way from
the head to the feet of the corpse. Its middle was
about the thickness of a rifle-barrel, and it then tapered
to something like whipcord to its tail. It was about
two feet long, snow white, and speckled with black and
red spots.</p>

<p>This, then, was the phantom death! Yonder
venomous reptile it was, then, that, creeping out of
some secret hiding-place, and visiting the unhappy
men one after another, had stung them in their sleep,
in the darkness of the cabin, and vanished before they
had struck a light and realized indeed that something
desperate had come to them!</p>

<p>Whilst I stood looking at the snake, whose horror
seemed to gain fresh accentuation from the very beauty
of its snow-white speckled skin and diamond-bright
eyes, the boatswain, armed with a long handspike, and
followed by a number of the crew, came headlong to
the cabin. He thrust the end of the handspike under
the belly of the creature, and hove it into the middle
of the berth.</p>

<p>“Stand clear!” he roared, and with a blow or two
smashed the reptile’s head into a pulp. “Open that
cabin window,” said he. One of the men did so, and
the boatswain with his boot scraped the mess of mashed
snake on to the handspike and shook it overboard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>“I told you they was poisoned,” he cried, breathing
deep; “and, oh my God, Mr. West—and I humbly ask
your pardon again for having suspected ye—do you
know, sir, whilst I was a-talking to you just now I was
actually thinking of taking up my quarters in this here
cabin this very night.”</p>

<p>Thus much: and now to end this singular experience
in a sentence or two. Three days after the
discovery of the snake we sighted and signalled a large
English merchantman bound to London from the Rio
de la Plata. Her chief officer came aboard, and we
related our story. He asked to see the snake. We
told him we had thrown it overboard. On my describing
it, he informed me that he guessed it was the little
poisonous reptile known in certain districts of South
America as the Ibiboboko. He returned to his ship,
and shortly afterwards the commander sent us his third
officer, with instructions to keep in company as long as
possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="BROKERS_BAY"><i>BROKERS’ BAY.</i></h2>

<p>Brokers’ Bay is situated on the West Coast of England.
You may search the map for it in vain, and the reason
why I call it by any other name than that it bears will,
when you have read this story, be as clear as the mud
in the water that brims to the base of Brokers’ cliffs.
Brokers’ Bay is a fine, curving sweep of land. For how
many centuries the sea has been sneakingly ebbing
from it who can imagine? The time has been when
the galleon and the carack strained at their hempen
ground tackle at anchors six fathoms deep where the
white windmill now stands within musket-shot of the
Crown and Anchor, and where the church spire darts
the gleam of its weathercock above the green thickness
of a huddle of dwarf trees near the little vicarage.</p>

<p>About fifty years ago a company of enterprising
souls took it into their heads to reclaim some of the
land which the subtly and ceaselessly ebbing sea, rising
and falling with moon-like regularity, yet receding ever,
though noticeably only in spans of half-centuries, was
leaving behind it. They armed themselves with the
necessary legal powers, they subscribed all the capital<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
they considered needful, and by processes of embanking,
draining, manuring, and the like, they succeeded in
raising wheat and grass, vegetables and flowers, where,
since and long before the days of the painted Briton,
shuddering in the November blast, or perspiring away
his small clothes under the July sun, nothing had
flourished but the dab and the crab.</p>

<p>Yet the speculation on the whole was a failure. It
was a patriotic achievement in its way, and those concerned
in it deserved well of the nation; for if it be a
fine thing to bleed for one’s country, how much finer
must it be to add to its dimensions, to enlarge its
latitude and longitude, and extend the home-sovereignty
of the monarch? Yet, though a pretty considerable
village stood hard by the reclaimed land, houses did not
increase. The builder, whose Christian name is Jerry,
came down to Brokers’ Bay, and took a look around,
and went home again, and did nothing. He was not
to be decoyed, he said. Brokers’ Bay was not the right
sort of place to start a town in, he thought. There was
too much mud, Mr. Jerry considered. He calculated
that when the water was out there was a full mile and
three-quarters of slime. Oh yes, whilst the slime was
still slimy it reflected the sky just the same as if it had
been water, and it took a noble blood-red countenance
of a hot sunset evening, when the sea was a pink
gleaming streak just under the horizon, and it was
very pleasing in that sort of way. But what were the
doctors going to say about all that mud, and what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
opportunities would a waste of slush, extending one and
three-quarter miles at ebb tide, provide the local historian
with when he came to write a guide-book and
invent Roman and Early English names for the immediate
district, and deal with the salubriousness of the
climate, and give an analysis of the drinking water?
And what about the bathing? There was none. And
what length of pier would be wanted if the seaward end
of it was to be permanently water-washed?</p>

<p>The reclaimed ground was divided into lots for
building; but nobody built. The soil continued to be
cultivated, nevertheless. Two market-gardeners did
very well out of it. A butcher rented thirty acres of
the pasture land; the remainder was variously dealt
with in small ways for growing purposes.</p>

<p>Now, that stretch of land had been reclaimed some
fifteen years, when a certain master mariner, whom I
will call Captain Carey, arrived at the adjacent village
with the intention of taking a view of the Brokers’ Bay
foreshore. News that good land was cheap hereabouts
had reached him up at Blyth. He had unexpectedly
come into a little fortune, had Captain Carey. For
years he had followed the coasting trade, working his
way out through the forescuttle into the captain’s
cabin, and after thirty years of seafaring, rendered
more and more uncomfortable by gloomy anticipations
of the workhouse in his old age, he had been enriched
by the will of an Australian aunt, the amount being
something between £9000 and £10,000.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>Captain Carey had sprung from a West Country
stock; his wife was a West Country woman, and when
they came into the Australian aunt’s legacy they determined
to break up their little home at Blyth and settle
somewhere on Western soil. So Captain Carey came
to Brokers’ Bay, and with him travelled his giant son,
a youth of prodigious muscle, but of weak intellect.
A second Titan son was at this time at sea, working
his way towards the quarter-deck aboard an East
Indiaman.</p>

<p>Captain Carey’s survey of the Brokers’ foreshore
determined him on purchasing a plot of land right
amidships of the fine curve of reclaimed soil. He
bought four acres at a very low figure indeed, and then
ordered a small house to be built in the midst of his
little estate. His wife and her niece joined him and
the giant half-witted son at the adjacent village, and
there the family dwelt at the sign of the Seven Bells
whilst the house was building.</p>

<p>It was quickly put together, and was then gay with
a green balcony, and it had motherly lubberly bay
windows that made you think of a whaler’s boats
dangling at cranes, and the entrance was embellished
with a singular porch after the design of the retired
master mariner, who had recollected seeing something
of the sort at Lisbon when he had gone as a boy on a
voyage to Portugal.</p>

<p>Captain Carey loved seclusion. Like most retired
mariners, he hated to be overlooked. This fondness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
for privacy, which grows out of a habit of it, may be
owing to there being no streets at sea, and no over-the-way.
The master of a vessel lives in a cabin all alone
by himself—the Crusoe of the after part of the ship.
He measures his quarter-deck in lonely walks; no
eyes glittering above the bulwark rail watch his movements;
his behaviour as a man, his judgment as a
seaman, but not his mode of life as a private individual,
are criticized by his crew. Hence, when a man steps
ashore after a long period of command at sea, he carries
with him a strong love of privacy, and much resolution
of retirement. A great number of little cottages by the
ocean are occupied by solitary seamen, who pass their
time in looking through a telescope at the horizon, in
arguing with lonesome men of their own cloth, in
smoking pipes at the Lugger Inn or at the sign of the
Lord Nelson, and turning in at night and turning out
in the morning.</p>

<p>To provide against being overlooked in case others
should build hard by, Captain Carey walled his little
estate of four acres with a regular bulkhead of a fence,
handsomely spiked on top, and too tall even for his
giant son to peer over on tiptoe. In a few months the
house was built, papered, and in all ways completed;
it was then furnished and the ground fenced. Captain
Carey and his family now took possession of their new
home. There was, first of all, Captain Carey, then Mrs.
Carey, next the giant young Carey (who had been known
up in Blyth by the name of Mother Carey’s chicken),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
and last, Mrs. Carey’s niece, a stout, active girl of
twenty, who helped Mrs. Carey in cooking and looking
after the house; for Carey, having been robbed, whilst
absent on a coasting voyage, of a new coat, a soft hat,
a meerschaum pipe, and a few other trifles by a maid-of-all-work,
had sworn in hideous forecastle language
never again to keep another servant.</p>

<p>This happy family of Careys were very well pleased
with their new home. Old Carey was never weary of
stepping out of doors to look at his house. He seemed
to find something fresh to admire every time he cast
his eyes over the little building. He and his son
planted potatoes, onions, cabbages, and other homely
vegetables, and dug out and cultivated a very considerable
area of kitchen garden. They had not above three
miles to walk to attend divine worship. There were
several convenient shops in the adjacent village, not
more than two miles and a half distant. There was no
roadway to speak of to Carey’s house, but in a very few
weeks the feet of the family and the tread of the tradespeople
tramped out a thin path over the reclaimed land
to the village roadway, where it fell with the sweep of
the cliff to the level of the reclaimed soil. And the
view, on the whole, from Carey’s windows was fairly
picturesque and pleasing, even when the water was out
and the scene was a sweeping flat of mud. Afar on the
dark blue edge of the sea hovered the feather-white
canvas of ships, easily resolved into denominationable
fabrics by Carey’s powerful telescope. The western sun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
glowed in the briny ooze till the whole stretch of the
stuff resembled a vast surface of molten gold. Here
and there, confronting Carey’s house, stood some scores
of fangs of rock, and when there was a flood-tide and a
fresh in-shore gale the sea snapped and beat and burst
upon the beach with as much uproar as though it were
all fathomless ocean, instead of a dirty stretch of water
with an eighteen-foot rise of tide, and foam so dark and
thick with dirt that, after it had blown upon you and
dried, it was as though you had ridden through some
dozen miles of muddy lanes.</p>

<p>The family had been settled about three months
when the eldest son arrived home from the long voyage
he had made to China and the East Indies. He was a
tall, powerfully-built young man; but his education in
his youth had been neglected. Captain Carey, indeed,
had not in those days possessed the means to put him
to school. Now, however, that the skipper had come
into a little fortune of, call it, £10,000, he resolved to
qualify his son for a position on the quarter-deck.</p>

<p>“Navigation I can teach him,” he said to his wife,
“and if he was a master-rigger he couldn’t know more
about a ship. What he wants is the sort of larning
which you and me’s deficient in: the being able to talk
and write good English, with some sort of knowledge of
history and the likes of that; so that, should he ever get
command of a passenger ship, why, then, sitting at the
head of the cabin table, he won’t be ashamed of addressing
the ladies and joining in the general conversation.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>So when this son arrived from China and the East
Indies, the father, instead of sending him to sea again,
put him to read and study with a clergyman who lived
in the adjacent village, a gentleman who could not
obtain a living and who disdained a curacy.</p>

<p>Thus it came to pass that Captain Carey lived at
home with his two sons and wife and wife’s niece.</p>

<p>He stood in a bay window one day, and it entered
his head to dig out a pond and place a fountain in the
middle of it.</p>

<p>“It’ll improve the property,” said Captain Carey,
turning to his wife and sons, who were lingering at the
breakfast-table. “We’ll fix a pedestal amidships of the
pond and put a female statue upon it—one of them
white figures who keep their right hands aloft for the
holding of a whirligig fountain. There’s nothing prettier
than a revolving fountain a-sparkling and a-showering
down over a noode statue.”</p>

<p>“You’ll be striking salt water, father, if you fall
a-digging,” said the sailor son named Tom.</p>

<p>“And what then?” exclaimed Captain Carey.
“Ain’t brine as bright to the eye as fresh water? And
it’s not going to choke the fountain either. Blessed if I
don’t think the fountain might be set a-playing by the
rise and fall of the tide.”</p>

<p>When breakfast was ended, the father and the two
sons stepped out of doors to decide upon a spot in which
to dig the pond for the fountain. After much discussion
they agreed to dig in front of the house, about a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
hundred paces distant, within a stone’s throw of the
wash of the water when the tide was at its height.</p>

<p>The Captain’s grounds lay open to the sea, though
they were jealously fenced, as has been already said, at
the back and on either hand. There could be no intrusion
on the sea-fronting portion of the grounds. The
mud came to the embankment, and the embankment
was the ocean-limit of Carey’s little estate. There was
no path, and no right of way if there had been. Selkirk
and his goats could scarcely have enjoyed greater
seclusion than did Carey and his family. The father
and sons proposed to dig out the pond to the shape,
depth, and area decided upon, and then bring in a
mason to finish it. They went to work next day; it
was something to do—something to kill the time which,
perhaps, now and again lay a little heavy upon this
isolated family. The old skipper dug with vehemence
and enjoyment. He had been bred to a life of hard
work, and was never happier than when toiling. His
giant half-witted son laboured with the energy of steam.
The sailor son stepped in when he had done with his
parson and his studies for the day, and drove his spade
into the reclaimed soil with enthusiasm. This went on
for several days, and something that resembled the idea
of a pond without any water in it began to suggest
itself to the eye.</p>

<p>It was on a Friday afternoon in the month of April,
as the Captain whom I am calling Carey himself
informed me, that this retired skipper, who had not felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
well enough that day to dig, was seated in his parlour
reading a newspaper and smoking a pipe. Suddenly
the door was flung open, and the giant half-witted youth
whose name was Jack walked in.</p>

<p>“Father,” said he, “ain’t gold found in the earth?”</p>

<p>“Nowhere else, sonny,” answered the Captain, looking
at the giant over the top of the newspaper.</p>

<p>“There’s gold in the pond, father,” said Jack.</p>

<p>“Gold in your eye!” exclaimed the Captain, putting
down his pipe and his newspaper. “What sort of
gold?” said he, smiling.</p>

<p>“Shiny gold, like the half-sovereign you wance gave
me for behavin’ myself when you was away.”</p>

<p>On this, Captain Carey, without another word, put
on his hat and walked with his son to the diggings,
which were by this time a pretty considerable trench.</p>

<p>“There,” said Jack, pointing, “my spade drove
upon him, and I’ve scraped that much clear.”</p>

<p>The Captain looked, and perceived what resembled a
fragment of a shaft of metal, dull and yellow, with lines
of brightness where Jack’s spade had scraped the surface.
He at once jumped into the trench and bade Jack
fetch his spade. They then dug together, and in about
a quarter of an hour succeeded in laying bare a small
brass cannon of very antique pattern and manufacture.
It was pivoted. They dug a little longer and deeper,
and exposed a portion of woodwork. The scantling was
extraordinarily thick, and the gun was pivoted to it.
The Captain’s face was red with excitement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>“Run and see if Tom’s in,” he cried, “and if he ain’t
leave word that he’s to join us with his spade as soon as
he arrives, and then come you back, Jack. By the
great anchor, if here ain’t a foundered ship call me a
guffy!”</p>

<p>The sailor son, armed with a spade, appeared on
the scene within twenty minutes.</p>

<p>“It’s an old brass swivel, father,” he shouted.</p>

<p>“Jump in,” cried the Skipper, “and len’s a hand to
clear away more of this muck.”</p>

<p>The three plied their spades with might and main,
and before sundown they had laid bare some eight feet
of ship’s deck, with about five feet breadth of bulwark,
measuring four feet high from the plank. Mrs. Carey
and the niece came to the edge of the pit to look. The
three diggers, covered with sweat and hot as fire,
climbed out, threw down their spades, and the family
stood gazing.</p>

<p>“Whatever is it?” cried Mrs. Carey.</p>

<p>“A foundered ship,” answered her husband.</p>

<p>“A whole ship, uncle?” exclaimed the niece.</p>

<p>“A three-hundred-ton ship,” answered the Skipper.
“D’ye want to know if she’s all here? I can’t tell you
that; but if there ain’t solidness enough for a <i>Ryle
Jarge</i> running fore and aft in this unearthed piece, I’m
no sailor man.”</p>

<p>“What sort of ship will she be?” said the half-witted
Jack.</p>

<p>“Something two hundred year old, if the whole job<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
hain’t some antiquarian roose like to the burying of
Roman baths for the digging of ’em up again as an
advertisement for the place. Who was a-reigning two
hundred year ago?”</p>

<p>Here every eye was directed at the sailor son, who,
after rubbing his nose and looking hard at the horizon,
answered, “Crummell.”</p>

<p>“Then it’s a ship of Crummell’s time,” cried the
Captain, to whom the name of Crummell did not seem
familiar, “and if so be she’s all here and intact, bloomed
if she won’t be a fortune to us as a show.”</p>

<p>That night, both at and after supper, all the talk of
the family was about the foundered ship in the garden.
The giant lad’s excitement was such that even the
mother owned to herself he had never been more fluent
and imbecile.</p>

<p>“D’ye think it’s a whole ship, father?” said Tom
the sailor.</p>

<p>“More’n likely. That there brass cannon ought to
give us her age. Haven’t I heered tell of a Spanish
invasion of this country in bygone years, when the
Dons was blowed to the nor’rad, and a score of their
galleons cast away upon the British coasts? At a time
like this a man feels not being a scholard. Tom, fetch
down your history book, and see if there’s a piece wrote
in it about that there Spanish job.”</p>

<p>The sailor brought a history of England to the lamp,
and with fingers square-ended as broken carrots, and
with palms dark with dragging upon tarry ropes, groped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
patiently through the pages till he came to a part of the
story that told of the Spanish Armada. This was read
aloud, and the family listened with attention.</p>

<p>“Well, she may prove to be one of them Spanish
galleons after all,” said Captain Carey. “She’ll not be
the first ship that’s been dug up out of land which the
sea’s flowed over in its day. There was Jimmy Perkins
of Sunderland——” And here he spun them a yarn.</p>

<p>“What’ll be inside the ship, I wonder?” exclaimed
the niece.</p>

<p>“Ah!” said the young giant Jack, opening his
mouth.</p>

<p>“Them galleons went pretty richly freighted, I’ve
heered,” said the Skipper. “When I was a boy they
used to tell of their going afloat with a store of dollars
in their holds, their bottoms flush to the hatches with
the choicest goods, gold and silver candlesticks and
crucifixes in the cabins for the captains and mates to
say their prayers afore.”</p>

<p>“Jacky thought the cannon gold,” said Mrs. Carey.
“He may be right, Thomas, though a little quick in
finding out. There may be gold deeper down.”</p>

<p>“Well, now,” cried the Skipper. “I’ll tell you what
I’ve made up my mind to do. We’ll keep this here find
a secret. Tom, you, me, and Jack’ll go to work day
arter day until we see what lies buried. There’s no call
for any of us to say a word about this discovery. We’re
pretty well out of sight, the fence stands high, and if so
be as any visitor or tradesman should catch a view of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
the trench they’ll not be able to see what’s inside without
drawing close to the brink, which, of course, won’t be
permitted. If that foundered craft,” he cried, with
great excitement, pointing towards the window, “is
intact, as I before observed, then let her hold contain
what it may, all mud or all dollars, all slush or all silk,
as a show she ought to be worth a matter of a thousand
pound to us. But not a word to anybody till we’ve
looked inside of her. If there’s treasure, why, it’s to be
ourn. There’s to be no dividing of it with the authorities,
and so I says plainly, let the law be what it will. Here’s
this house and grounds to be paid for, Tom to be
eddicated and sent to sea in a ship he holds a share in,
Jack to be made independent of me, and Eliza to be
provided for; and we’ll see,” he shouted, hitting the
table a blow with his clenched fist, “if that there
foundered ship ain’t a-going to work out this traverse
the same as if she was chock-a-block with bullion.”</p>

<p>Thus was the procedure settled, and next morning
early the father and two sons went to work with their
spades.</p>

<p>It was to prove a long, laborious job; they knew
that, but were determined all the same to keep the
strange business in the family, and to solve the secret
of the buried craft as darkly and mysteriously as though
they were bent upon perpetrating some deed of horror.
The quantity of soil they threw up formed an embankment
which concealed the trench and their own labouring
figures as they progressed. Tom went away to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
studies for two or three hours in the day; saving this
and the interruption of meal-times their toil was unintermittent.
In three weeks they had disclosed enough
of the poop-royal, poop, and quarter-deck of the strangely-shaped
craft to satisfy them that, at all events, a very
large portion of the after part of the vessel lay solid in
its centuries-old grave of mud.</p>

<p>In this time they had exhumed and scraped the
whole breadth or beam of her upper decks to a distance
of about twenty-two feet forward from the taffrail.
Their notion was to clear her from end to end betwixt
the lines of her bulwarks, only to satisfy themselves
that she was a whole ship. Day after day they laboured
in their secret fashion, and the people of the district
never for an instant imagined that they were at work on
anything more than an entrenchment of extraordinary
size, depth, and length, for some purpose known only
to themselves.</p>

<p>It took them to the middle of July to expose the
upper decks of the vessel; and then there lay, a truly
marvellous and even beautiful sight, buried some ten
feet below the level of the soil, the complete and quite
perfect fabric of a little antique ship of war, about one
hundred feet long and thirty feet broad, with two after
decks or poops descending like steps to the quarter-deck,
and the bows shelving downwards like the slope
of a beach into what promised to prove a complicated
curling of headboards and some nightmare device of
figure-head. Four little brass cannons were pivoted on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
the poop rails, and on her main deck she mounted eight
guns of that ancient sort called sakers. The wood of
her was as hard as iron, and black as old oak with the
saturation of soil and brine and time’s secret hardening
process. The masts were clean gone from the deck,
and there was no sign of a bowsprit. Never was there
a more wonderful picture than that ancient ship as she
lay in her grave with her grin of old-world artillery
running the fat squab length of her, the whole structure,
flat still in the soil to the level of the bulwark rails,
affecting the eye as some marvellous illusion of nature;
as some wild, romantic vegetable or mineral caprice of
the drained but sodden soil.</p>

<p>Our little family of diggers, having disentombed the
decks and bulwarks to the whole length of the giant
Jack’s extraordinary discovery, next proceeded, all as
secretly as though they were preparing for some hideous
crime, to uproot the covers of the main-hatch, which
were as hard-fixed as though they had been of Portland
stone cemented into a pier. With much hammering,
however—and they were three powerful men—they
succeeded in splitting the cover, and the stubborn,
wonderful old piece of timber-frame was picked
out of the yawn of the hatch in splinters. And now
they looked down into a black well, from which
Captain Carey speedily withdrew his head, sniffing and
spitting.</p>

<p>“Run for a candle, Jack,” said he.</p>

<p>A candle was lighted and lowered, and when it had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
sunk half a dozen feet the flame went out as though the
wick had been suddenly pinched by the fingers of a
spirit. So that a current of air should sweeten the hold,
they went aft with their hatchets and hammers, and,
after prodigious labour, splintered and cleared away the
cover of a little booby hatch just under the break of
the lower poop. They next got open the small fore
hatch, and at the end of two days, when they lowered
a lighted candle, the flame burnt freely.</p>

<p>Now, what did they find inside this buried ship?
Carey had counted upon mud to the hatchways, and
scores of curios and amazing relics of Crummell’s or
another’s period to be dug out of the solid mass.
Instead, the interior was as dry as a nut whose kernel
has rotted into dust. <em>This</em> was as extraordinary as any
other feature of the discovery. The three men, each
bearing a lighted lantern, descended the ladder they had
lowered through the hatch, and gained the bottom of
the ship, where they walked upon what had undoubtedly
been cargo in its time, though it might now have passed
for a sort of dunnage of lava, dry, harsh, and gritty,
and powdering under the tread. A basket was loaded
with the stuff, and hoisted into the daylight and examined,
but the family could make nothing of it. As
far as could be gathered, the original freight of the ship
had been bale goods, skins, fine wool, and the like, East
India or Spice Island commodities, which some sort of
chemical action had transformed into a heap of indistinguishable
stuff, as slender in comparison with its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
radical bulk as the cinders of a rag to the rag that
is burnt.</p>

<p>“Nothing to make our fortunes with here,” said
Captain Carey, as he stood in the bottom of this
wonderful old ship’s hold with his two sons, the three
of them holding up their lanterns and glancing with
gleaming eyes and marvelling minds around. “What’s
abaft that bulkhead? We’ll see to it arter dinner.”</p>

<p>They went to dinner, and then returned to the
ship, and applied themselves to hacking at the bulkhead
so as to effect an entry. This bulkhead, which
partitioned the after from the main and fore holds,
was of the hardness of steel. They let fly at it in
vain. The hollow hold reverberated the blows of axe
and chopper with the clangour of an iron ship-building
yard.</p>

<p>“We must enter by an after-hatch if it’s to be
done,” said Captain Carey.</p>

<p>With infinite labour, which expended the day and
ran into the whole of the following morning, they contrived
to break their way through the front of the lower
poop. Here the air was as foul as ever it had been
in the hold. They could do nothing for many hours.
When at last the atmosphere was sweet enough to
breathe they entered, and found themselves in a cabin
that was unusually lofty owing to the superstructure
of the poop-royal. The interior was as dry as the
hold had been. So effectually had accident or contrivance,
or the secret processes of the ship’s grave,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
sealed every aperture that, standing in this now wind-swept
cabin, you might have supposed the little fabric
had never shipped a bucketful of water from the hour
of her launch. Several human skeletons lay upon
the deck. The Captain and his sons held the lanterns
to the bones, and handled the rags which had been
their raiment, but the colourless stuff went to pieces.
It mouldered in the grasp as dry sand streams from
the clenched fist.</p>

<p>Five cabins were bulkheaded off this black, long-buried
interior. The Captain and his sons searched
them, but everything that was not of timber appeared
to have undergone the same transformation that was
visible in what had doubtless been the cargo in the
hold. They found chairs of a venerable pattern,
cresset-like lamps, such as Milton describes, bunk
bedsteads, upon which were faintly distinguishable the
tracings of what might have been paintings and gilt-work.</p>

<p>“What d’ye think of this, boys, for a show?” cried
Captain Carey, whose voice was tremulous with excitement
and astonishment. “If there ain’t two thousand
pound in the job as a sight-going consarn, tell me
we’re all a-dreaming, and that the whole boiling’s a
lie. And now to see what’s under hatches here.”</p>

<p>A small square of hatchway was visible just abaft
the black oblong table that centred the interior. They
opened this hatch without much labour. The cementing
process of the ship’s grave had not apparently worked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
very actively in this cabin, yet the foul air of the
after-hold forced them once more upon no less than
three days of inactivity; for to sweeten the place they
were obliged to construct a windsail, whose breezy heel
rendered the atmosphere fit for human respiration in a
few hours.</p>

<p>On descending they found just such another accumulation
of lava-like remains of freight as they had met
with in the main-hold. But they also noticed a bulkhead
ten feet abaft the sternpost. They chopped their
way through it, and stood for awhile peering around
them under the lanterns which they held above their
heads. The gleams illuminated a quantity of ancient
furniture—sofas and chairs and little tables, and framed
squares and ovals of obliterated paintings. Captain
Carey put his hand upon a couch, and drew away his
fist full of pale and rotted upholstery.</p>

<p>“Are those things cases yonder?” said the sailor
son, and the three of them made their way to a
corner of the hold and stood looking for a moment
or two at four square chests heavily clamped with
iron.</p>

<p>“What’s here?” said Captain Carey.</p>

<p>The giant Jack stooped and strove to stir one of
the boxes.</p>

<p>“Stand aside!” roared the Skipper, and with half a
dozen strokes of his axe, he split open the lid of one of
the chests.</p>

<p>The three faces came together in a huddle, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
the light shone upon lines of linked and minted
metal.</p>

<p>“Pick out one of ’em, Tom,” said Captain Carey,
in a faint voice; “my hands are a-trembling too much
to do it.”</p>

<p>They were Spanish silver coins, subsequently ascertained
to have been minted in times which proved the
age of this sunken and recovered ship contemporaneous
with the early years of the reign of our Second
Charles. Captain Carey told me that he realized £6400
on them.</p>

<p>But this lucky family did better yet with their incredible
discovery; for after the Captain had secreted
the money in his house, he called in workmen, who dug
away the soil from the buried ship until she was
exposed to the bilge on which she rested. This done,
he carried out his resolution to make a show of her
by erecting a shed for the fabric, stationing a door-keeper
at the entrance, and charging sixpence for
admission. Many hundreds, indeed many thousands,
came from all parts to view the wonderful ship, that
was ascertained, by what is called an “expert” in naval
affairs, to have been the <i>Sancte Ineas</i>, captured by
the privateer <i>Amazon</i>, and lost whilst proceeding in
charge of a prize crew to an English port. It was
further discovered that her lading had consisted of
coffee, cochineal, indigo, hides in the hair, bales of
fine wool and fur. But down to this hour it was never
known that Captain Carey had found hidden, and, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
course of time, cleverly turned into good English
money, four chests of Spanish silver, worth, at all
events to this happy family of Brokers’ Bay, £6400.
For my own part, I have honourably kept my worthy
friend’s secret.</p>

<h2 id="THE_LAZARETTE_OF_THE_HUNTRESS"><i>THE LAZARETTE OF THE “HUNTRESS.”</i></h2>

<p>I stepped into the Brunswick Hotel in the East India
Docks for a glass of ale. It was in the year 1853, and
a wet, hot afternoon. I had been on the tramp all day,
making just three weeks of a wretched, hopeless hunt
after a situation on shipboard, and every bone in me
ached with my heart. My precious timbers, how poor
I was! Two shillings and threepence—that was all
the money I possessed in the wide world, and when I
had paid for the ale, I was poorer yet by twopence.</p>

<p>A number of nautical men of various grades were
drinking at the bar. I sat down in a corner to rest,
and abandoned myself to the most dismal reflections.
I wanted to get out to Australia, and nobody, it seems,
was willing to ship me in any situation on any account
whatever. Captains and mates howled me off if I
attempted to cross their gangways. Nothing was to be
got in the shipping yards. The very crimps sneered at
me when I told them that I wanted a berth. “Shake
your head, my hawbuck,” said one of them, in the
presence of a crowd of grinning seamen, “that the
Johns may see the hayseed fly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>What was I, do you ask? I’ll tell you. I was one
of ten children whose father had been a clergyman, and
the income “from all sources” of that same clergyman
had never exceeded £230 a year. I was a lumbering,
hulking lad, without friends, and, as I am now perfectly
sensible, without brains, without any kind of taste for
any pursuit, execrating the notion of clerkships, and
perfectly willing to make away with myself sooner than
be glued to a three-legged stool. But enough of this.
The long and short is, I was thirsting to get out to
Australia, never doubting that I should easily make my
fortune there.</p>

<p>I sat in my corner in the Brunswick Hotel, scowling
at the floor, with my long legs thrust out, and my
hands buried deep in my breeches pockets. Presently
I was sensible that some one stood beside me, and,
looking up, I beheld a young fellow staring with all his
might, with a slow grin of recognition wrinkling his
face. I seemed to remember him.</p>

<p>“Mr. William Peploe, ain’t it?” said he.</p>

<p>“Why yes,” said I; “and you—and you——?”</p>

<p>“You don’t remember Jem Back, then, sir?”</p>

<p>“Yes I do, perfectly well. Sit down, Back. Are
you a sailor? I am so dead beat that I can scarcely
talk.”</p>

<p>Jem Back brought a tankard of ale to my table,
and sat down beside me. He was a youth of my
own age, and I knew him as the son of a parishioner
of my father. He was attired in nautical clothes, yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
somehow he did not exactly look what is called a sailor
man. We fell into conversation. He informed me
that he was an under-steward on board a large ship
called the <i>Huntress</i>, that was bound out of the Thames
in a couple of days for Sydney, New South Wales. He
had sailed two years in her, and hoped to sign as head
steward next voyage in a smaller ship.</p>

<p>“There’ll be a good deal of waiting this bout,” said
he; “we’re taking a cuddy full of swells out. There’s
Sir Thomas Mason—he goes as Governor; there’s his
lady and three daughters, and a sort of suet” (he
meant suite) “sails along with the boiling.” So he
rattled on.</p>

<p>“Can’t you help me to find a berth in that ship?”
said I.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid not,” he answered. “What could you
offer yourself as, sir? They wouldn’t have you forward,
and aft we’re chock-a-block. If you could manage to
stow yourself away—they wouldn’t chuck you overboard
when you turned up at sea; they’d make you useful,
and land you as safe as if you was the Governor
himself.”</p>

<p>I thought this a very fine idea, and asked Back to
tell me how I should go to work to hide myself. He
seemed to recoil, I thought, when I put the matter to
him earnestly, but he was an honest, kindly-hearted
fellow, and remembered my father with a certain degree
of respect, and even of affection; he had known me
as a boy; there was the sympathy of association<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
and of memory between us; he looked at the old suit
of clothes I sat in, and at my hollow, anxious face,
and he crooked his eyebrows with an expression of
pain when I told him that all the money I had
was two and a penny, and that I must starve and
be found floating a corpse in the dockyard basin if
I did not get out to Australia. We sat for at least
an hour over our ale, talking very earnestly, and
when we arose and bade each other farewell I had
settled with him what to do.</p>

<p>The <i>Huntress</i> was a large frigate-built ship of 1400
tons. On the morning of the day on which she was to
haul out of dock I went on board of her. Nobody took
any notice of me. The vessel was full of business,
clamorous with the life and hurry of the start for the
other side of the world. Cargo was still swinging over
the main hold, down whose big, dark square a tall,
strong, red-bearded chief mate was roaring to the
stevedore’s men engulfed in the bowels of the ship. A
number of drunken sailors were singing and cutting
capers on the forecastle. The main-deck was full of
steerage, or, as they were then termed, ’tween-deck
passengers—grimy men, and seedy women and wailing
babes, and frightened, staring children. I did not
pause to muse upon the scene, nor did I gaze aloft at
the towering spars, where, forward, up in the dingy sky
of the Isle of Dogs, floated that familiar symbol of
departure, Blue Peter. I saw several young men in
shining buttons and cloth caps with gold badges, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
knew them to be midshipmen, and envied them. Every
instant I expected to be ordered out of the ship by
some one with hurricane lungs and a vast command of
injurious language, and my heart beat fast. I made
my way to the cuddy front, and just as I halted beside a
group of women at the booby hatch, James Back came
to the door of the saloon. He motioned to me with
a slight toss of his head.</p>

<p>“Don’t look about you,” he whispered; “just follow
me straight.”</p>

<p>I stepped after him into the saloon. It was like
entering a grand drawing-room. Mirrors and silver
lamps sparkled; the panelled bulkheads were rich with
hand paintings; flowers hung in plenty under the skylight;
goldfish gleamed as they circled in globes of
crystal. These things and more I beheld in the space
of a few heart-beats.</p>

<p>I went after James Back down a wide staircase that
sank through a large hatch situated a dozen paces from
the cuddy front. When I reached the bottom I found
myself in a long corridor, somewhat darksome, with
cabins on either hand. Back took me into one of those
cabins and closed the door.</p>

<p>“Now listen, Mr. Peploe,” said he. “I’m going to
shut you down in the lazarette.” He pulled a piece of
paper from his pocket, on which was a rude tracing.
“This is the inside of the lazarette,” he continued,
pointing to the tracing. “There are some casks of
flour up in this corner. They’ll make you a safe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
hiding-place. You’ll find a bag of ship’s biscuit and
some bottles of wine and water and a pannikin stowed
behind them casks. There’s cases of bottled ale in the
lazarette, and plenty of tinned stuffs and grub for the
cabin table. But don’t broach anything if you can hold
out.”</p>

<p>“When am I to show myself?”</p>

<p>“When we’re out of Soundings.”</p>

<p>“Where’s that?” said I.</p>

<p>“Clear of the Chops,” he answered. “If you come
up when the land’s still in sight, the captain’ll send you
ashore by anything that’ll take you, and you’ll be
handed over to the authorities and charged.”</p>

<p>“How shall I know when we’re clear of the Chops?”
said I.</p>

<p>“I’ll drop below into the lazarette on some excuse
and tell you,” he answered. “You’ll be very careful
when you turn up, Mr. Peploe, not to let them guess
that anybody’s lent you a hand in this here hiding job.
If they find out I’m your friend, then it’s all up with
Jem Back. He’s a stone-broke young man, and his
parents’ll be wishing of themselves dead rather than
they should have lived to see this hour.”</p>

<p>“I have sworn, and you may trust me, Back.”</p>

<p>“Right,” said he. “And now, is there e’er a
question you’d like to ask before you drop below?”</p>

<p>“When does the ship haul out?”</p>

<p>“They may be doing of it even whilst we’re talking,”
he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>“Can I make my escape out of the lazarette should
I feel very ill, or as if I was going to suffocate?”</p>

<p>“Yes, the hatch is a little ’un. The cargo sits tall
under him, and you can stand up and shove the hatch
clear of its bearings should anything go seriously wrong
with you. But don’t be in a hurry to feel ill or short
o’ breath. There’s no light, but there’s air enough.
The united smells, perhaps, ain’t all violets, but the
place is warm.”</p>

<p>He paused, looking at me inquiringly. I could
think of nothing more to ask him. He opened the door,
warily peered out, then whispered to me to follow, and
I walked at his heels to the end of the corridor near the
stern. I heard voices in the cabins on either hand of
me; some people came out of one of the after berths,
and passed us, talking noisily, but they took no heed
of me or of my friend. They were passengers, and
strangers to the ship, and would suppose me a passenger
also, or an under-steward, like Jem Back, who, however,
now looked his vocation, attired as he was in a camlet
jacket, black cloth breeches, and a white shirt.</p>

<p>We halted at a little hatch-like trap-door a short
way forward of the bulkheads of the stern cabins.
Back grasped the ring in the centre of the hatch, and
easily lifted the thing, and laid open the hold.</p>

<p>“All’s clear,” said he, looking along the corridor.
“Down with you, Mr. Peploe.” I peered into the
abyss, as it seemed to me; the light hereabouts was so
dim that but little of it fell through the small square of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
hatchway, and I could scarcely discern the outlines of
the cargo below. I put my legs over and sank, holding
on with a first voyager’s grip to the coaming of the
hatch: then, feeling the cargo under my feet, I let go,
and the instant I withdrew my hands, Back popped the
hatch on.</p>

<p>The blackness was awful. It affected me for some
minutes like the want of air. I thought I should
smother, and could hardly hinder myself from thrusting
the hatch up for light, and for the comfort of my lungs.
Presently the sense of suffocation passed. The corridor
was uncarpeted; I heard the sounds of footsteps on the
bare planks overhead, and, never knowing but that at
any moment somebody might come into this lazarette,
I very cautiously began to grope my way over the cargo.
I skinned my hands and my knees, and cut my small
clothes against all sorts of sharp edges in a very short
time. I never could have realized the like of such a
blackness as I was here groping through. The deepest
midnight overhung by the electric cloud would be as
bright as dawn or twilight compared to it.</p>

<p>I carried, however, in my head the sketch Back had
drawn of this interior, and remembering that I had
faced aft when my companion had closed me down, I
crawled in the direction in which I imagined the casks
and my stock of bread and wine lay; and to my great
joy, after a considerable bit of crawling and clawing
about, during which I repeatedly wounded myself, I
touched a canvas bag, which I felt, and found full of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
ship’s bread, and on putting my hand out in another
direction, but close by where the bag was, I touched
a number of bottles. On this I felt around, carefully
stroking the blackness with my maimed hands, and
discovered that I had crawled into a recess formed by
the stowage of a number of casks on their bilge; a little
space was left behind them and the ship’s wall; it was
the hiding-place Back had indicated, and I sat down to
breathe and think, and to collect my wits.</p>

<p>I had no means of making a light; but I don’t
believe that in any case I should have attempted to
kindle a flame, so great would have been my terror of
setting the ship on fire. I kept my eyes shut, fancying
that that would be a good way to accustom my vision
to the blackness. And here I very inopportunely
recollected that one of the most dreadful prison punishments
inflicted upon mutinous and ill-behaved felons
is the locking of them up in a black room, where it is
thought proper not to keep them very long lest they
should go mad; and I wondered how many days or
hours it would take to make a lunatic of me in this
lazarette, that was as black certainly as any black room
ever built for refractory criminals.</p>

<p>I had no clothes save those I wore. Stowaways as
a rule do not carry much luggage to sea with them. I
had heard tell of ships’ slop-chests, however, and
guessed, when I was enlarged and put to work, the
captain would let me choose a suit of clothes and pay
for them out of my wages. I did not then know that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
it is not customary for commanders of ships to pay
stowaways for their services. Indeed, I afterwards got
to hear that far better men than the average run of
stowaway were, in their anxiety to get abroad, very
willing to sign articles for a shilling a month, and lead
the lives of dogs for that wage.</p>

<p>I had come into the ship with a parcel of bread and
cheese in my pocket: feeling hungry I partook of this
modest refreshment, and clawing round touched a bottle,
pulled the loosely-fitted cork out, and drank. This
small repast heartened me; I grew a little less afraid
of the profound blackness, and of the blue and green
lights which came and went upon it, and began to hope
I should not go mad.</p>

<p>The hours sneaked along. Now and again a sort of
creaking noise ran through the interior, which made
me suppose that the ship was proceeding down the river
in tow of a tug. Occasionally I heard the tread of
passengers overhead. It pleased me to hear that sound.
It soothed me by diminishing the intolerable sense of
loneliness bred by the midnight blackness in which I
lay. The atmosphere was warm, but I drew breath
without difficulty. The general smell was, indeed, a
complicated thing; in fact, the lazarette was a store-room.
I seemed to taste ham, tobacco, cheese, and
fifty other such matters in the air.</p>

<p>I had slept very ill on the preceding night, and after
I had been for some hours in the lazarette I felt weary,
and stretched myself along the deck between the casks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
and the ship’s wall, and pillowed my head on my coat.
I slept, and my slumber was deep and long. My dreams
were full of pleasing imaginations—of nuggets of
extraordinary size, chiefly, and leagues of rich pasture
land whitened by countless sheep, all branded with the
letter P. But after I had awakened and gathered my
wits together, I understood that I had lost all count of
time, that I should not know what o’clock it was, and
whether it was day or night, until I had got out. I was
glad to find that the blackness was not so intolerable as
I had dreaded. I felt for the biscuits and bottles, and
ate and drank as appetite dictated. Nobody in all this
while lifted the hatch. No doubt the steward had plenty
of stores for current use in hand, and there might be no
need to break out fresh provisions for some weeks.</p>

<p>I had lain, according to my own computation, very
nearly two days in this black hole, when I felt a movement
in the ship which immediately upset my stomach.
The vessel, I might suppose, was in the Channel; her
pitching grew heavier, the lazarette was right aft, and
in no part of the vessel saving the bows could her
motion be more sensibly felt. I was speedily overcome
with nausea, and for many long hours lay miserably ill,
unable to eat or drink. At the expiration of this time
the sea ran more smoothly; at all events, the ship’s
motion grew gentle; the feeling of sickness suddenly
passed, leaving me, indeed, rather weak, yet not so
helpless but that I could sit up and drink from a bottle
of wine and water, and eat a dry ship’s biscuit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>Whilst I was munching the tasteless piece of sea
bread, sitting in the intense blackness, pining for the
fresh air and the sunshine, and wondering how much
longer I was to wait for Back’s summons to emerge, the
hatch was raised. I shrank and held my breath, with
my hand grasping the biscuit poised midway to my
mouth, as though I had been withered by a blast of
lightning. A faint sheen floated in the little square.
It was the dim lustre of distant lamplight, whence I
guessed it was night. The figure of a man cautiously
dropped through the hatchway, and by some means,
and all very silently, he contrived to readjust the hatch,
shutting himself down as Back had shut me down. The
motion of the ship, as I have said, was gentle, the
creaking noises throughout the working fabric were dim
and distant; indeed, I could hear the man breathing as
he seemed to pause after bringing the hatchway to its
bearings over his head. I did not suppose that the
captain ever entered this part of the ship. The man,
for all I could conjecture, might be one of the mates, or
the boatswain, or the head steward, visiting the lazarette
on some errand of duty, and coming down very quietly
that the passengers who slept in the cabins on either
hand the corridor should not be disturbed. Accordingly,
I shrank into the compactest posture I could contort
myself into, and watched.</p>

<p>A lucifer match was struck; the flame threw out the
figure of a man standing on the cargo just under the
hatch; he pulled out a little bull’s-eye lamp from his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
pocket and lighted it, and carefully extinguished the
match. The long, misty beam of the magnified flame
swept the interior like the revolving spoke of a wheel as
the man slowly turned the lens about in a critical search
of the place, himself being in blackness. The line of
light broke on the casks behind which I crouched, and
left me in deep shadow unperceived. After some minutes
of this sort of examination, the man came a little way
forward and crouched down upon a bale or something of
the sort directly abreast of the casks, through whose
cant-lines I was peering. He opened the lamp and
placed it beside him; the light was then full upon his
figure.</p>

<p>He might have been an officer of the ship for all
I knew. His dress was not distinguishable, but I had
his face very plain in my sight. He was extremely
pale; his nose was long and aquiline; he wore
moustaches, whiskers, and a short beard, black, but
well streaked with grey. His eyebrows were bushy and
dark; his eyes were black, and the reflected lamplight
shot in gleams from them, like to that level spoke of
radiance with which he had swept this lazarette. His
hair was unusually long, even for that age of the
fashion, and his being without a hat made me guess he
was not from the deck, though I never doubted that he
was one of the ship’s company.</p>

<p>When he opened the bull’s-eye lamp and put it
down, he drew something out of his pocket which
glittered in his hand. I strained my sight, yet should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
not have managed to make out what he grasped but for
his holding it close to the light; I then saw that it
was a small circular brass box; a kind of little metal
cylinder, from whose side fell a length of black line, just
as tape draws out of a yard measure. He talked to
himself, with a sort of wild, scowling grin upon his face,
whilst he inspected his brass box and little length of
line; he then shut the lamp and flashed it upon what I
saw was a medium-sized barrel, such, perhaps, as a
brewer would call a four-and-a-half gallon cask. It
rested on its bilge, after the manner in which the casks
behind which I lay hidden were stowed.</p>

<p>I now saw him pull a spile or spike of wood out of
the head of the barrel, and insert the end of the black
line attached to the small brass piece in the orifice.
This done he fitted a key to the brass box and wound it
up. He may have taken twenty turns with the key;
the lazarette was so quiet that I could distinctly hear
the harsh grit of the mechanism as it was revolved. All
the while he was thus employed he preserved his scowling
smile, and whispered to himself. After he had
wound up the piece of clockwork he placed it on the
bale where his lamp had stood, and taking the light
made for the hatchway, under which he came to a stand
whilst he extinguished the bull’s-eye. I then heard him
replace the hatch, and knew he was gone.</p>

<p>The arrangement he had wound up ticked with the
noise of a Dutch clock. I had but little brains in those
days, as I have told you, and in sad truth I am not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
overloaded with that particular sort of cargo at this
hour; but I was not such a fool as not to be able to
guess what the man intended to do, and what that
hollow, desperate ticking signified. Oh, my great God,
I thought to myself, it is an infernal machine! and the
ship will be blown up!</p>

<p>My horror and fright went far beyond the paralyzing
form; they ran a sort of madness into my blood and
vitalized me into desperate instant action. Utterly
heedless <em>now</em> of hurting and wounding myself, I scrambled
over the casks, and, directed by the noise of the ticking,
stretched forth my hand and grasped the brass machine.
I fiercely tugged it; then feeling for the slow match, as I
guessed the line to be, I ran it through my fingers to
make sure I had pulled the end out of the barrel. The
murderous thing ticked in my hand with the energy of a
hotly-revolved capstan, whilst I stood breathing short,
considering what I should do, whilst the perspiration
soaked through my clothes as though a bucket of oil
had been upset over me. Heavens! the horror of
standing in that black lazarette with an infernal
machine ticking in my hands, and a large barrel of
gunpowder, as I easily guessed, within reach of a kick
of my foot! I trembled in every limb and sweated at
every pore, and seemed to want brains enough to tell
me what ought next to be done!</p>

<p>How long I thus stood irresolute I don’t know; still
clutching the hoarsely-ticking piece of clockwork, I
crawled in the direction in which I supposed lay the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
casks behind which I had hidden. I had scarcely advanced
half a dozen feet when the mechanism snapped
in my fingers; a bright flash, like to the leap of a flame
in the pan of a flint musket, irradiated the lazarette;
the match was kindled, and burnt freely. The first
eating spark was but small; I extinguished the fiery
glow between my thumb and forefinger, squeezing it in
my terror with the power of the human jaw. The ticking
ceased; the murderous thing lay silent and black
in my hand. I waited for some minutes to recover myself,
and then made up my mind to get out of the
lazarette and go on deck, and tell the people that there
was a barrel of gunpowder in the after-hold, and that I
had saved the ship from having her side or stern blown
out.</p>

<p>I pocketed the brass box and match, but it took me
above half an hour to get out of the infernal hole. I
fell into crevices, went sprawling over pointed edges,
and twice came very near to breaking my leg. Happily,
I was tall, and when I stood on the upper tier of cargo
I could feel the deck above me, and once, whilst thus
groping, I touched the edge of the hatchway, thrust up
the cover, and got out.</p>

<p>I walked straight down the corridor, which was sown
with passengers’ boots, mounted the wide staircase, and
gained the quarter-deck. I reeled and nearly fell, so intoxicating
was the effect of the gushing draught of
sweet, fresh night-wind after the stagnant, cheesy
atmosphere of the lazarette. A bull’s-eye shone on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
face of a clock under the break of the poop; the hour
was twenty minutes after two. Nothing stirred on the
main-deck and waist; the forward part of the ship was
hidden in blackness. She was sailing on a level keel
before the wind, and the pallid spaces of her canvas
soared to the trucks, wan as the delicate curls and
shreds of vapour which floated under the bright
stars.</p>

<p>I ascended a flight of steps which led to the poop,
and saw the shadowy figures of two midshipmen walking
on one side the deck, whilst on the other side,
abreast of the mizzen rigging, stood a third person. I
guessed by his being alone that he was the officer of the
watch, and stepped over to him. He drew himself
erect as I approached, and sang out, “Hallo! who the
devil are you?”</p>

<p>“I’m just out of your lazarette,” said I, “where I’ve
saved this ship from having her stern blown out by an
infernal machine!”</p>

<p>He bent his head forward and stared into my face,
but it was too dark for him to make anything of me. I
reckoned he was the second mate; his outline against
the stars defined a square, bullet-headed, thick-necked
man. On a sudden he bawled out to the two midshipmen,
who had come to a stand on t’other side the
skylight—</p>

<p>“Mr. Freeling, jump below and call the captain.
Beg him to come on deck at once, young gentleman.”</p>

<p>The midshipman rushed into the cuddy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>“What’s this yarn about blowing out the ship’s
stern?” continued the second mate, as I rightly took
him to be.</p>

<p>I related my story as straightforwardly as my command
of words permitted. I told him that I had wanted
to get to Australia, that I was too poor to pay my passage,
that I had been unable to find employment on
board ship, that I had hidden myself in the lazarette of
the <i>Huntress</i>, and that whilst there, and within the past
hour, I had seen a man fit a slow match into what I
reckoned was a barrel of gunpowder, and disappear after
setting his infernal machine a-going. And thus speaking,
I pulled the machine out of my pocket, and put it
into his hand.</p>

<p>At this moment the captain arrived on deck. He
was a tall man, with a very deep voice, slow, cool, and
deliberate in manner and speech.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” he inquired, and instantly
added, “Who is this man?”</p>

<p>The second mate gave him my story almost as I had
delivered it.</p>

<p>The captain listened in silence, took the infernal
machine, stepped to the skylight, under which a lamp
was dimly burning, and examined the piece of mechanism.
His manner of handling it by some means
sprang the trigger, which struck the flint, and there
flashed out a little sun-bright flame that fired the
match. I jumped to his side and squeezed the fire out
between my thumb and forefinger as before. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
captain told the two midshipmen to rouse up the chief
mate and send the boatswain and carpenter aft.</p>

<p>“Let there be no noise,” said he to the second mate.
“We want no panic aboard us. Describe the man,”
said he, addressing me, “whom you saw fitting this
apparatus to the barrel.” I did so. “Do you recognize
the person by this lad’s description?” said the
captain to the second mate.</p>

<p>The second mate answered that he knew no one on
board who answered to the likeness I had drawn.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, I swear he’s in the ship!” I cried, and
described him again as I had seen him when the open
bull’s-eye allowed the light to stream fair upon his face.</p>

<p>But now the arrival of the chief officer, the boatswain,
and the carpenter occasioned some bustle. My
story was hastily re-told. The carpenter fetched a
lantern, and the whole group examined the infernal
machine by the clear light.</p>

<p>“There’s no question as to the object of this piece
of clockwork, sir,” said the chief officer.</p>

<p>“None,” exclaimed the captain; “it flashed a few
minutes ago in my hand. The thing seems alive.
Softly, now. The passengers mustn’t hear of this:
there must be no panic. Take the boatswain and
carpenter along with you, Mr. Morritt, into the lazarette.
But mind your fire.” And he then told them
where the barrel was stowed as I had described it.</p>

<p>The three men left the poop. The captain now
examined me afresh. He showed no temper whatever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
at my having hidden myself on board his ship. All his
questions concerned the appearance of the man who
had adjusted the machine, how he had gone to work,
what he had said when he talked to himself—but this
question I could not answer. When he had ended his
enquiries he sent for the chief steward, to whom he
related what had happened, and then asked him if
there was such a person in the ship as I had described.
The man answered there was.</p>

<p>“What’s his name?”</p>

<p>“He’s booked as John Howland, sir. He’s a steerage
passenger. His cabin’s No. 2 on the starboard
side. His meals are taken to him into his cabin, and
I don’t think he’s ever been out of it since he came
aboard.”</p>

<p>“Go and see if he’s in his cabin,” said the captain.</p>

<p>As the steward left the poop the chief mate, the
boatswain, and carpenter returned.</p>

<p>“It’s as the young man states, sir,” said Mr.
Morritt. “There’s a barrel of gunpowder stowed where
he says it is, with a hole in the head ready to receive
the end of a fuse.”</p>

<p>“Presently clear it out, and get it stowed away in
the magazine,” said the captain, calmly. “This has
been a narrow escape. Carpenter, go forward and
bring a set of irons along. Is there only one barrel
of gunpowder below, d’ye say, Mr. Morritt?”</p>

<p>“No more, sir.”</p>

<p>“How could such a thing find its way into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
lazarette?” said the captain, addressing the second
mate.</p>

<p>“God alone knows!” burst out the other. “It’ll
have come aboard masked in some way, and it deceived
me. Unless there’s the hand of a lumper in the job—does
<em>he</em> know no more about it than what he says?”
he cried, rounding upon me.</p>

<p>At this moment the steward came rushing from the
companion way, and said to the captain, in a trembling
voice, “The man lies dead in his bunk, sir, with his
throat horribly cut.”</p>

<p>“Come you along with us,” said the captain,
addressing me; and the whole of us, saving the carpenter
and second mate, went below.</p>

<p>We walked along the corridor obedient to the captain’s
whispered injunction to tread lightly, and make no
noise. The midnight lantern faintly illuminated the
length of the long after passage. The steward conducted
us to a cabin that was almost right aft, and
threw open the door. A bracket lamp filled the interior
with light. There were two bunks under the porthole,
and in the lower bunk lay the figure of the man I had
beheld in the lazarette. His throat was terribly gashed,
and his right hand still grasped the razor with which
the wound had been inflicted.</p>

<p>“Is that the man?” said the captain.</p>

<p>“That’s the man,” I answered, trembling from head
to foot, and sick and faint with the horror of the
sight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>“Steward, fetch the doctor,” said the captain,
“and tell the carpenter we shan’t want any irons
here.”</p>

<p class="tb">The narrative of my tragic experience may be completed
by the transcription of two newspaper accounts,
which I preserve pasted in a commonplace book. The
first is from the <cite>Sydney Morning Herald</cite>. After telling
about the arrival of the <i>Huntress</i>, and the disembarkation
of his Excellency and suite, the writer
proceeds thus:—</p>

<p>“When the ship was five days out from the Thames
an extraordinary incident occurred. A young man
named William Peploe, a stowaway, whilst hidden in
the lazarette of the vessel, saw a man enter the place
in which he was hiding and attach a slow match and
an infernal machine to a barrel of gunpowder stored
amidships of the lazarette, and, from what we can
gather, <em>on top of the cargo</em>! When the man left the
hold, young Peploe heroically withdrew the match from
the powder and carried the machine on deck. The
youth described the man, who proved to be a second-class
passenger, who had embarked under the name of
John Howland. When the villain’s cabin was entered
he was found lying in his bunk dead, with a severe
wound in his throat inflicted by his own hand. No
reason is assigned for this dastardly attempt to destroy
a valuable ship and cargo and a company of souls
numbering two hundred and ten, though there seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
little reason to doubt that the man was mad. It is
certain that but for the fortunate circumstance of
young Peploe lying hidden in the lazarette the ship’s
stern or side would have been blown out, and she must
have gone down like a stone, carrying all hands with
her. On the passengers in due course being apprised
of their narrow escape, a purse of a hundred guineas
was subscribed and presented by his Excellency to
young Peploe. The captain granted him a free passage,
and provided him with a comfortable outfit from the
ship’s slop-chest. It is also understood that some
situation under Government has been promised to Mr.
William Peploe in consideration of the extraordinary
service rendered on this memorable occasion.”</p>

<p>My next quotation is from the pages of the <cite>Nautical
Magazine</cite>, dated two years subsequent to the publication
of the above in the Australian paper:—</p>

<p>“A bottle was picked up in March last upon the
beach of Terceira, one of the Azores, containing a paper
bearing a narrative which, unless it be a hoax, seems
to throw some light on the mysterious affair of the
<i>Huntress</i>, for the particulars of which we refer our
readers to our volume of last year. The paper, as
transmitted by the British Consul, is as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“Ship <i>Huntress</i>. At sea, such and such a date, 1853.</p>

<p>“I, who am known on board this vessel as John
Howland, am the writer of this document. Twenty
years ago I was unjustly sentenced to a term of transportation
across seas, and my treatment at Norfolk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
Island was such that I vowed by the God who made
me to be revenged on the man who, acting on the
representation of his creatures, had caused me to be
sent from Hobart Town to that hellish penal settlement.
That man, with his wife and children, attended by a
suite, is a passenger in this ship, and I have concerted
my plan to dispatch him and those who may be dear to
him to that Devil to whom the wretch consigned my
soul when he ordered me to be sent as a further punishment
to Norfolk Island. The destruction of this ship
is ensured. Nothing can avert it. A barrel of gunpowder
was stowed by well-bribed hands in the East
India Docks in the lazarette, to which part of the hold
access is easy by means of a small trap-door. I am
writing this three-quarters of an hour before I proceed
to the execution of my scheme, and the realization of
my dream of vengeance. When I have completed this
document I will place it in a bottle, which I shall carefully
cork and seal and cast into the sea through my
cabin porthole. I am sorry for the many who must
suffer because of the sins of one; but that one must
perish, and immediately, in which hope, craving that,
when this paper is found, it may be transmitted to the
authorities at home, so that the fate of my bitter enemy
may be known, I subscribe myself,</p>

<h2 id="A_MEMORY_OF_THE_PACIFIC"><i>A MEMORY OF THE PACIFIC.</i></h2>

<p>It was in December, 1858, that the ship <i>Walter Hood</i>
shifted her berth to the wool-sheds at Sydney to load
a cargo for London. I was chief officer of the vessel;
my name, let me say here, is Adam Chichester.</p>

<p>I was standing on the wharf near the ship, waiting
for the arrival of some waggons of wool, when the
master of a German vessel that lay just astern of us
came up to me, and said—</p>

<p>“Dot vhas a bad shob last night.”</p>

<p>“What was?” said I.</p>

<p>“Haf not you heard of der brudal murder in
Shorge Street?”</p>

<p>“I have not seen a morning paper.”</p>

<p>“She vhas dot small chop vhere dey sells grocery
und odder tings on der left going oop. She vhas a
Meester Abney, dey say. Der murderer vhas a beas’ly
rogue called Murray; she helped in der shop; she
hod been a soldier. Dis morning poor Abney vhas
found dead in her bedt mit her troat cut und her skull
sphlit.”</p>

<p>“Have they got the murderer?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>“No. Dot vhas der pity. He make clean off mit
sixty pound.”</p>

<p>Throughout the day people coming and going talked
of this murder. The yarn ran thus:—Mrs. Abney
occupied a room next to the murdered man’s; the son,
Thomas, a youth of about eighteen, used an apartment
at the back of the shop; the servant lay in the attics;
the assistant, Murray, lodged out. Neither Mrs. Abney,
her son, nor the servant had heard a sound in the
night; Murray had broken into the house, passed into
Abney’s room, and murdered him; then from a safe,
whose key Abney kept under his pillow, he had taken
about sixty sovereigns; all so noiselessly, the footfalls
of a cat are not stiller. The family slept on, and
the murder was not discovered till half-past seven in
the morning.</p>

<p>It was known by these damning tokens that Murray
was the murderer: first, the knife Abney’s throat had
been cut with was Murray’s; after using it he had
dropped it behind some paper in the bedroom grate.
Next, when he had shifted himself at his lodgings he
had buried the clothes in the back garden; a dog
belonging to the woman of the house was observed
to run into the garden with its nose stooped as though
on a trail, and, stopping where the bundle was buried,
it began to scratch and howl. The woman called a
neighbour; they went to the place with a spade and
found Murray’s clothes, covered with bloodstains.</p>

<p>The man himself was off, and the people who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
from time to time during the day gave me news of
this thing told me he was still at large, that the
police were in hot pursuit, and there was no hope
for him.</p>

<p>That evening I strolled up George Street for a walk,
and saw a great crowd at the Abneys’ shop. I stopped
to stare with the rest of them. They call this sort of
curiosity vulgar and debasing. But crime puts the
significance of human emotion, misery, and remorse
into stocks and stones. Human passion gives the
vitality of romance, tragic or comic, to the most
sordid and contemptible aspects of the commonplace.
I had passed that grocer’s shop twenty times, and
often looked at the house. I looked at it again now,
and found the matter-of-fact structure as strange,
grotesque, repulsive as a nightmare.</p>

<p>The days rolled on; Murray remained at large.
His escape, or at least his marvellous manner of hiding,
was the source of more excitement than the murder
itself had proved. Most people supposed he had got
clean away and was lurking among the islands, unless
he was halfway on the road to Europe or America;
others, that he had struck inland and had perished
in the wilds.</p>

<p>But by degrees of course the matter went out of
one’s head; out of mine certainly. Before the ship
sailed I could walk up George Street and look at the
shop and think of other things than the murder. Yet
the memory of it was freshened a day or two before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
the tug got hold of us by the commander of the ship,
Captain Charles Lytton, telling me that amongst those
who had taken berths in the steerage were the widow
and son of the murdered man.</p>

<p>“I’m almost sorry they chose this ship,” said he,
with an uneasy half-laugh. “For my part I’d as lief
sail on a Friday as carry anything with such a shadow
upon it as murder.”</p>

<p>“They’re long in catching Murray,” said I.</p>

<p>“It’s no fault of the police,” he answered. “We’re
not in England here. A brisk walk takes a man into
desolation. When you talk of catching a murderer,
you think of beadles and fire-engines, and the electric
telegraph. But the black man is still in this country;
there’s never a village pump betwixt Wooloomooloo
and the Antarctic circle. Small wonder your bush-ranger
flourishes.”</p>

<p>We sailed on a Monday in the beginning of
February, having been belated by the breakdown of
some transport machinery in the interior. There went
about a dozen people to the steerage company, and
we carried ten passengers in the saloon. The <i>Walter
Hood</i> was a smart and beautiful clipper of a vanished
type; elliptical stern, a swelling lift of head with an
exquisite entry of cut-water, coppered to the bends,
a green hull, yards as square as a frigate’s, with a
noble breast of topsail and royal yards hoisting close
under the trucks, man-of-war style. On a wind, one
point free, she could have given her tow-rope to any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
Blackwall liner then afloat and not known there was
anything in her wake.</p>

<p>When we were clear of the Heads, I came aft after
seeing to the ground tackle, and in the waist saw a
woman in deep mourning, looking over the rail at the
receding land. A young fellow stood beside her. He
too was in black. I cannot recall a finer specimen of
a young man than that youth. His height was about
six feet. He held himself erect as a soldier. His
breadth of shoulder warranted in him the hurricane
lungs of a boatswain. He was looking at the land,
and his face was hard with a fixed and dark expression
of grief.</p>

<p>The third mate was near. I whispered to him to
say if those two were the Abneys. He answered they
were. When some time later on I had leisure to look
about me, I observed that the widow of the murdered
man and her son held aloof from their fellow-passengers
down on the main-deck. She always appeared with a
veil on. She and the youth would get together in
some corner or recess, and there sit, talking low. The
steerage folks treated them with a sort of commiserative
respect, as though affliction had dignified the pair.
The steward told me he had picked up that, after the
murder of Abney, the widow had sold off the contents
of the shop and her furniture; she was going home to
live with her sister, the wife of a tradesman at Stepney.
He told me that the son often spoke of his father’s
murder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>“His notion is,” said the steward, “that Murray’s
out of the colony, and’s to be found in England. That’s
his ’ope. He’s a bit crazed, I think, with some queer
dream of meeting of him, and talks, with his eyes
shining, of a day of reckoning. Otherwise he’d have
stayed in Sydney, where he’s got friends, and where
his father’s murder was likely to have improved his
prospects by bringing him pity and business.”</p>

<p>When the Australian coast was out of sight, the
wind chopped from the westward into the south, and
blew a wonderful sailing breeze, bowling a wide heave
of sea from horizon to horizon in lines of milky ridges
and soft, dark blue valleys, freckled as with melting
snow, and along this splendid foaming surface rushed
the ship with the westering sunlight red as blood in
every lifting flash of her wet sheathing. So through
the night; the white water full of fire poured away on
either hand the thunderous stem; the purely-shining
stars reeled above our phantom heights of sail faint
as steam.</p>

<p>At ten a corner of crimson moon rose over our bows,
to be eclipsed for awhile by the shadowy square of
a ship’s canvas right ahead; but before the moon had
brightened into silver we had the stranger abeam of
us, and were passing her as though she were at
anchor—a lubberly, blubberly whaler, square-ended,
with stump topgallant-masts—a splashing grease-box
gamely tumbling in our wake with a convulsive sawing
and shearing of her masts and yardarms, as though,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
sentient but drunken too, the lonely fabric sought to
foul the stars with her trucks, and drag the stellar
system out of gear.</p>

<p>So through next day, and a whole week of days
and nights following; then the breeze scanted one
afternoon, and at sundown it was a glassy calm, with
a languid pulse of swell out of the south-east, and a
sky of red gold, shaded with violet cloud, brighter
eastwards when the sun was set than astern where
the light had been.</p>

<p>The middle watch was mine that night. I turned
out with a yawn at midnight, and going on deck found
the reflection of the moon trembling with the brushing
of a delicate warm catspaw of wind; the sails were
asleep, and the ship was wrinkling onwards at two
knots. The moon was over our port main-topsail
yardarm, and being now hard upon her full, and
hanging in a perfectly cloudless sky, she filled the
night with a fine white glory till the atmosphere looked
to brim to the very stars with her light; the Southern
Cross itself in the south shone faint in that spacious
firmament of moonlight.</p>

<p>I never remember the like of the silence that was
upon that sea; the sense of the solitude of the prodigious
distances worked in one like a spirit, subduing
the heart with a perception of some mysterious inaudible
<em>hush</em>! floating to and meeting <em>in</em> the ship out of every
remote pale ocean recess. I had used the sea for years,
and knew what it was to lie motionless under the Line<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
for three weeks, stirless as though the keel had been
bedded in a sheet-flat surface of ice or glass; but never
before had the mystery, the wonder, the awe which
dwell like sensations of the soul itself in any vast scene
of ocean night that is silent as death, and white as
death too with overflowing moonlight, affected and
governed me as the beauties and sublime silence of
this midnight did.</p>

<p>The second mate went below, and I paced the deck
alone. Saving the fellow at the helm, I seemed to be
the only man in the ship. Not a figure was visible.
But then I very well knew that to my call the deck
would be instantly clamorous and alive with running
shapes of seamen.</p>

<p>After I had walked a little while, I crossed to the
port side where the flood of moonshine lay shivering
upon the ocean, and looked at the bright white rim of
the sea under the moon, thinking I saw a sail there.
It was then I heard a faint cry; it sounded like a
halloaing out upon the water on the port bow. I
strained my ears, staring ahead with intensity. Then,
hearing nothing, I supposed the sound that had been
like a human voice hailing was some creaking or
chafing noise aloft, and I was about to resume my
walk when I heard it again, this time a distinct,
melancholy cry.</p>

<p>“Did you hear that, sir?” cried the fellow at the
wheel.</p>

<p>I answered “Yes,” and sung out for some hands to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
get upon the forecastle and report anything in sight.
The halloaing was repeated; in a few minutes a man
forward hailed the poop and told me there was a boat
or something black two points on the port bow; on
which I shifted the helm for the object, which the night-glass
speedily resolved into the proportions of a small
open boat, with a man standing up in her.</p>

<p>By this time the captain, who had been aroused by
our voices, was on deck. We floated slowly down upon
the little boat, and the captain hailed to know if the
man had strength to scramble aboard alone.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Then look out for a line.”</p>

<p>The boat came under the bow; a rope’s end was
thrown and caught. The man languidly climbed into
the fore-channels, omitting to secure the boat, which
drove past and was already in our wake whilst the
fellow was crawling over the side. Some of our seamen
helped him over the rail, and he then came aft,
walking very slowly, with an occasional reel in his gait,
as though drunk or excessively weak.</p>

<p>He mounted the poop ladder with the assistance of
a seaman. The moonlight was so bright it was almost
the same as seeing things by day. He was a short,
powerfully built man, habited in the Pacific beach-comber’s
garb of flannel shirt and dungaree breeches,
without a hat or shoes; his hair was long and wild,
his beard ragged; he was about thirty years of age,
with a hawksbill nose, and large protruding eyes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
hollow-cheeked, and he was of the colour of a corpse
as he faced the moon.</p>

<p>He begged for a drink and for something to eat, and
food and a glass of rum and water were given to him
before he was questioned.</p>

<p>He then told us he had belonged to the Colonial
schooner <i>Cordelia</i> that had been wrecked five days
before on a reef, how far distant from the present
situation of our ship he did not know. The master
and Kanaka crew left the wreck in what he called the
long-boat. He said he was asleep when the schooner
grounded. He did not apparently awaken until some
time after the disaster; when he came on deck he
found the schooner hard and fast and deserted. A
small boat was swinging in davits; he lowered her
and left the wreck, unable to bring away anything to
eat or drink with him, as the hold was awash and the
vessel quickly going to pieces and floating off in staves.</p>

<p>He delivered this yarn in a feeble voice, but
fluently. Undoubtedly he had suffered; but somehow,
as I listened, I could not satisfy myself that what had
befallen him had happened just as he stated.</p>

<p>He asked what ship ours was, and looked round
quickly when he was told she was the <i>Walter Hood</i>
from Sydney bound to London. The captain asked
him what his rating had been aboard the schooner;
he answered, “Able seaman.” He was then sent forward
into the forecastle.</p>

<p>I went below at four, and was again on deck at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
eight, and learned that the man we had rescued was
too ill to “turn to,” as we call it. The ship’s doctor
told me he was suffering from the effects of privation
and exposure, but that he was a hearty man, and would
be fit for work in a day or two. He had told the doctor
his name was Jonathan Love, and that the <i>Cordelia</i>
belonged to Hobart Town, at which place he had
joined her. The doctor said to me he did not like his
looks.</p>

<p>“I make every allowance,” he went on, “for hairiness
and colour, and for the expression which the
sufferings a man endures in a dry, starving, open boat
at sea will stamp upon his face, sometimes lastingly.
There’s an evil memory in the eyes of that chap. He
glances at you as though he saw something <em>beyond</em>.”</p>

<p>“Men of a sweet and angelic expression of countenance
are rarely met with in these seas,” said I.</p>

<p>“Likely as not he will prove an escaped convict,”
said the doctor.</p>

<p>Three days passed, and Love still kept his hammock.
But now the doctor reported him well, and the captain
sent orders to the boatswain to turn the man to and
find out what he was fit for. This happened during a
forenoon watch which was mine. The day had broken
in splendour. Masses of white cloud were rolling their
stately bulk, prismatic as oyster-shells, into the north-east,
and the blue in the breaks of them was of the
heavenly dye of the Pacific. The ship was curtsying
forwards under breathing topsails and studding-sails,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
and the cuddy breakfast being ended, all the passengers
were on deck.</p>

<p>I stood at the head of the starboard poop ladder,
watching the steerage passengers on the main deck.
I took particular notice, I recollect, on this occasion,
of the Abneys, widow and son, as they sat on the
coaming of the main-hatch, the youth reading aloud
to his mother. It was the contrast, I suppose, of
the heavy crape and thick veil of the woman with the
light tropic garments of the rest of the people which
invited my eyes to the couple. I found my mind recalling
as best my memory could the particulars of
the horrible crime the widow’s sombre clothes perpetuated.</p>

<p>Then it was, and whilst I was recreating the picture
of the shop in George Street, that I observed the young
fellow lift his gaze from the page it had been fastened
to, violently start, then leap to his feet with a sudden
shriek. He was looking at the man we had rescued;
<em>he</em> stood in the waist, trousers upturned, arms bared,
posture as erect as a soldier’s; a formidable iron figure
of a fellow of medium height, ragged with hair about
the head and face.</p>

<p>“Mother,” yelled the young fellow almost in the
instant of his first shriek, whilst the rescued man
turned to look at him. “Father’s murderer!—James
Murray!—There he is!”</p>

<p>“Not by the son—not by the son!” shouted Murray,
holding out his arms as the other rushed towards him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
“Not by <em>you</em>! He’s got his father’s looks! Any man
else—but——”</p>

<p>Before the young fellow could grasp him, Murray,
in a single leap, swift and agile as a goat’s, had gained
the fore-rigging, and was halfway up the shrouds, the
young fellow after him.</p>

<p>“Not you!” roared the murderer, “not with your
father’s face on you! S’elp me God, it <em>shan’t</em> be, then!”
and, rounding to the sea, he put his hands together and
shot overboard, brushing the outstretched hand of his
pursuer as he flashed past him.</p>

<p>“Pick us up! He must hang for it. Drowning’s
too easy! He murdered my father!” and thus shouting
the lad sprang into the water.</p>

<p>Such a scene of confusion as now followed defies my
pen. The ceaseless screaming of the poor widow complicated
the uproar. I bawled to the man at the wheel
to put the helm down, then for hands to lay aft to clear
away and lower a boat. All our passengers were from
Sydney; most of the crew had shipped at that port;
every one there had heard of the murder of Mr. Abney;
and the effect of the discovery that we had fallen in with
the murderer who had so long and successfully eluded
justice, that he had been on board the ship three days,
that he was yonder floating on our quarter, with the
murdered man’s son making for him with bold furious
sweeps of his arm—was electrical! Women shrieked
and men roared; overhead the sails flapped as the
ship came to the wind, and there was the further noise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
of the heavy tread of seamen, the flinging down of ropes,
my own and the captain’s sharp commands.</p>

<p>When I had time to look, I beheld a death-struggle
in the sea some quarter of a mile distant. They had
grappled. God knows what intention was in the young
fellow’s mind; it may be he hoped to keep the murderer
afloat till the boat reached them. They churned up
the foam as though it was white water there boiling
on some fang of rock.</p>

<p>The moment the boat put off, an awful silence fell
upon the ship.</p>

<p>“Pull, men, pull!” the captain shouted, and the
brine flew in sheets from the oars as the little fabric
sprang forward. But though the crew with the second
mate in the stern-sheets toiled like demons, they were
too late. The boat was within three of her own lengths
of the spot, when the two men disappeared. We watched
breathless, with a very madness and anguish of expectation,
for a sight of the head of one or the other of
them; but idly: and after the boat had hung some
three-quarters of an hour about the place where they
had vanished, with the second mate standing up in
her, eagerly looking around, she was recalled, hoisted,
and we proceeded on our voyage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="SO_UNNECESSARY">“<i>SO UNNECESSARY!</i>”</h2>

<p>In 1851 (he began—and who it was that began will
quickly appear) I was in command of a small but well-known
East Indiaman. She was loading for Bombay
in the West India Docks in the month of August, and
on returning home one afternoon I found a letter from
an old friend whom I had not set eyes on for above
three years. His name was Mills—Captain Francis
Mills.</p>

<p>He had just heard (he wrote) that I was in command
of the <i>Hecla</i>, and that she was to sail for Bombay in the
middle of September. He wanted to send his daughter
to India in charge of a trustworthy friend. Would I
dine with him and talk the matter over?</p>

<p>I was then living in Shadwell, and Mills hailed from
the other end of London. However, I promised to dine
with him on the following Sunday, and with the help
of the Blackwall railway and omnibuses I kept my
word.</p>

<p>Mills was about sixty years old, a white-haired, red-faced
man; he had used the sea for above thirty years,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
had built, owned, and commanded ships, and was now
moored in a plain, comfortable house out of Westbourne
Grove. His wife had long been dead. He had one
child, a daughter, to whom I had supposed him so
deeply attached, that I was surprised on reading his
letter to find him willing to part with her. I recollected
her as a pretty girl; but after three years of ocean
and travel one’s memory of a person grows dim. Miss
Minnie Mills was not at home when I arrived. The old
skipper and I found many things to talk about before
we came to the point; by-and-by he said—</p>

<p>“My daughter—do you remember her, Cleaver?”</p>

<p>“I do.”</p>

<p>“She is engaged to be married. She got in tow
with a parson two years ago. He was home from India,
and we met him at the house of a clergyman whose
church we attend. He’s chaplain at Junglepore, in
a corner of the Punjaub, and is now ready to marry her.
He’s come into a trifle of money, and I want to send her
out to him.”</p>

<p>“I wonder you can part with her.”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, and so do I wonder. But I’m getting
on in years. I wish to see her settled with some one to
look after her before my life-lines are unrove. She
has no mother. Then, again, I don’t mind owning she’s
a bit uneasy, and she makes me so too; hankers a trifle
too much after pleasure; wants to go to the theatre
when there’s nobody to take her; pines for a few friends
when I don’t feel well. She’s young, and her animal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
spirits run high, and custom, I dare say, is beginning to
sicken the sympathy in her,” said he, looking at his
left hand, which was rugged with gout, every finger with
a “list to port.” “Parting with her will be like parting
with half my heart; but it’s for her good, and the man
she’s going to is as worthy, sober, straight-headed
and pious a person as the most anxious parent could
wish to see his daughter in charge of.”</p>

<p>“You want to send her out by the <i>Hecla</i>?”</p>

<p>“I want to send her out with you.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you know I’m a bachelor?” said I.</p>

<p>“Pah!” he exclaimed, grinning. “An old ape
hath an old eye. You are to windward now, Cleaver.
Keep so, my lad, keep so.”</p>

<p>“I was never commissioned in this way before,” said
I; “but I shall be happy to oblige you in anything.
If your daughter goes as passenger in my ship, she
shan’t lack care and kindness. No man better than
you knows a skipper’s duties. A captain’s eyes aren’t
like a cod’s. He can’t see round corners without a shift
of nose—scarcely more than straight ahead, mostly.
But I’ll do my best, and that best shall be a pleasure
to me.”</p>

<p>We shook hands. Soon after this Miss Minnie
Mills came into the room. I stood up and bowed to as
handsome a young creature as ever flashed an eye at a
man. Indeed, the instant impression of her beauty
was disheartening; it flung a sudden weight into my
obligation, and I bowed a little nervously over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
hand I held. At seventeen she had been pretty merely,
slight in form, reserved in manner; now she was a
woman, very handsomely clothed with her sex’s charms.
Her face was full of life; vivacity and spirit were in
every turn and move of her. She had dark brown eyes,
deep, bland, and eloquent with light; her hair was a
dark red, like bronze, and she had plenty of it; her
complexion was of a charming soft whiteness, tinged
with colour, as though either cheek reflected the shadow
of a rose; and my bachelor eyes found a particular
beauty in a very delicate spangling of golden freckles—they
gave a summer sunny look to her beauty, ripening
it till somehow you thought of orchards, and a prospect
of cornfields reddened with poppies.</p>

<p>At dinner our talk was mainly of India and the
voyage to it, of Junglepore and the duties of the Reverend
Joseph Moxon. Miss Minnie did not flush, nor did
her eyes sparkle, nor did she manifest any particular
emotion of any sort when we talked of India and Mr.
Moxon. I thought she tried to divert the conversation
from those topics: she asked me what theatres I had
been to since my arrival in England; if I did not love
dancing; for her part she adored it, she said—dancing
and music. Old Captain Mills stuck stoutly in his talk
to India and Moxon. When I asked Miss Minnie how
she liked the notion of a residence in India, she pouted
her lips kissingly, and glanced at her father, but not
wistfully.</p>

<p>“You’ll get plenty of dancing out in India,” said I.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
“At most of the stations a man, I understand, has little
more to do than cut capers.”</p>

<p>“Moxon won’t have it,” said Captain Mills.</p>

<p>“He shan’t prevent me from enjoying myself!”
exclaimed the girl, with a note of mutiny.</p>

<p>Captain Mills, with one eye closed, viewed me steadfastly
with the other over the top of the wine-glass he
poised.</p>

<p>It was arranged that he should bring his daughter
to the ship on the following Tuesday, to look at the vessel
and choose a cabin. I turned the fancy of her marriage
over in my head from time to time till she came to the
ship with her father, wondering that the old skipper did
not see what would be plain to everybody: I mean that
he was sending the girl out to be married to a man she
had no liking for, who did not dance and would not
allow his wife to dance; who did not sing, and possibly
objected to profane music; who, as my imagination
figured, and as, indeed, I had gathered from what Mills
had let fall, was just a plain, homely clergyman of
decided views, without title to a bride of beauty and
gaiety. His choice would have been well enough in
a captain of Dragoons; in a parson it was highly improper.
I suppose Mills counted upon association doing
the work of sentiment. It might end in the girl making
a devoted wife, and in the clergyman looking coldly
upon her. I had sailed with some romantic commodities
in my time, and had lived to see more than one surprising,
unexpected issue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>Father and daughter came to the ship, and I was
on board when they arrived. The <i>Hecla</i> was a comfortable,
handsomely equipped vessel. She carried a cuddy,
or saloon, with sleeping-berths on either hand; the
furniture and fittings were of the old-world sort; strips
of mirror panelled the bulkheads; the shaft of mizzen-mast
was hand-painted; a pianoforte was secured to the
back of it; the skylights were large and handsome.</p>

<p>I had supposed that the girl would take some interest
in, or show some pleasure at, the sights about her.
She glanced languidly, and exhibited a spiritlessness of
manner, as though the thought of leaving her father
was beginning to sit very heavily upon her heart.</p>

<p>I observed, however, that, whilst she barely had
eyes for the ship, she did not neglect to look at the
chief mate, Mr. Aiken, who stood at the main-hatch
superintending some work that was going on. He was
a good-looking man, and it was therefore intelligible
that the girl should notice him. He was a smart officer,
and understood his duty, and continued to shout orders
and sing down instructions to the fellows in the hold,
insensible of our presence. Aiken was about thirty
years of age; his face was coloured by weather into the
manly hue of the ocean calling; he had white teeth,
a finely chiselled profile, an arch, intelligent, dark grey
eye. Captain Mills looked at him whilst we stood on
the quarter-deck after coming out of the cuddy, but
seemed more struck by the smartness of his demeanour
and general air than by the beauty of his face. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
old salt was full of the ship, and could think of little
else. All sorts of memories crowded upon him now that
he was in the docks.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t go to it again,” he exclaimed in a broken
voice; “yet I love the life—I love the life!”</p>

<p>Miss Minnie chose a berth on the port side. I
asked if she meant to bring a maid with her.</p>

<p>“No,” says Captain Mills. “She can do without a
maid. What scope of purse, Cleaver, do you suppose
I ride to?”</p>

<p>“If I can do without a maid on shore,” said Miss
Minnie, “I can do without one at sea.”</p>

<p>A note of complaint ran through her sentences, as
though she had a mind to make a trouble of things.</p>

<p>“A maid,” said Captain Mills, “will be sea-sick till
you’re up with the Cape, and idle and useless and
carrying on with the steward for the rest of the time till
you go ashore, and then she’ll leave you to get married.”</p>

<p>As we went to the gangway the mate made a step to
let us pass. Miss Minnie looked at him again, and
went over the side holding her father’s arm with a
sudden life in her movements, as though the sight of
a handsome man had worked up the whole spirit of the
coquette in her.</p>

<p>I felt rather sorry for the Reverend Joseph Moxon as
I followed the couple on to the quay, hugely admiring the
fine floating grace of the girl’s figure, the sparkle of her
dark eye as she turned her head to look at the ship, the
rich tinge her hair took from the sun. In fact, I seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
to find an image of the Reverend Joseph Moxon in old
Mills’ square, lurching figure alongside the sweet shape
of his daughter; and <em>that</em> set me thinking of well-bred,
jingling, handsome young officers at Moxon’s station,
where life would provide plenty of leisure for looking
and for sighing.</p>

<p>We towed down to Gravesend on a wet morning.
Nature is incapable of a gloomier exhibition of wretchedness
than the scene she will paint you of the Isle of
Dogs and Bugsby’s Beach and the yellow stretch of
water past Woolwich on a wet day. We had convict
hulks moored in the river in those times, and they fitted
the dark weeping weather as though they were creations
of the spirit of the stream in its sulkiest and most
depraved temper of invention. Their influence, too, as
a spectacle was a sickness to the soul of the outward-bound,
whilst the decks streamed and the scuppers
gushed and the rigging howled to the whipping of the
wet blast, and the greasy water washed into the wake in
a sort of oily ironic chuckling, as though the filthy god
of the flood was in tow, and laughing under the ship’s
counter at the general misery aboard.</p>

<p>We moored to a buoy off Gravesend in the afternoon,
and next morning, whilst it was still raining, the
passengers arrived. Amongst the first to mount the
gangway ladder were Captain Mills and his daughter.
I received them and took them into the cuddy, and did
my best to cheer up the old man; but to no purpose.
He broke down when the three of us were by ourselves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
and sobbed in a strange, dry-eyed, most affecting
manner, often turning to his daughter and bringing her
to his heart and blessing her in tones which I confess
made my own vision dim. She was pale with weeping.</p>

<p>She cried out once when he turned to fondle her—</p>

<p>“Father, I don’t want to go! I don’t love him
enough to leave you. Let me remain with you; we will
return home together. It is not too late. Captain
Cleaver will send my baggage ashore.”</p>

<p>This, I think, served to rally the old chap somewhat.
He pulled his faculties together, and in a trembling
voice bade his daughter remember that the man she
was going to loved her, and was worthy to be loved in
return. He himself was getting old, he said, and his
closing days would be miserable if he believed he should
die and leave her without a protector. A year is
quickly lived through: she would soon be coming on
a visit to England; or perhaps—who could tell?—he
might himself go out the next voyage in this very
identical ship, with his friend Cleaver, if he then
commanded her.</p>

<p>When he was gone I called to the stewardess and
bade her see to Miss Mills’ comfort in every direction of
the cabin life. The rest of the cuddy passengers arrived
quickly from Gravesend. I forget how many they were
in all. I believe that every cabin was occupied. The
people were of the usual sort in those days of the
voyage to India by way of the Cape: a colonel and his
wife, the colonel a black-faced man, with gleaming eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
that followed you to the extremities of their sockets;
the wife a vast, shapeless bulk of a woman, her head
covered by a wig of scarlet curls and her fingers with
flashing rings, sheathing them to the first joints;
several military officers of various ages; a parson;
two merchants of Bombay; five or six ladies, and as
many children.</p>

<p>We met with heavy weather down Channel. In this
time I saw nothing of Miss Mills, though I was constant
in my inquiries after her. She was not very ill, the
stewardess told me. She ate and drank, but she chose
to keep her cabin. One morning, when the ship was
flapping sluggishly over a wide heave of swell, clothed
to the trucks in misty sunshine, which poured like pale
steam into the recesses of the ocean, the girl came on
deck. She was charmingly attired (I thought); her
dark red hair glowed like bronze under the proudly
feathered hat. Her complexion was raised; her eyes
shone; the Channel dusting had done her good, and
I told her so, looking with helpless admiration into her
beautiful face as I gave her my arm for a turn.</p>

<p>After this she was punctual at table and constantly
on deck. I then considered it fortunate for the Rev.
Joseph Moxon that our military passengers should be,
without exception, married men; the two or three who
were going out alone were either leaving or joining their
wives: hence the attention the girl received was without
significance. They hung about her; they ran on
errands; they were full of business when she hove in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
sight, so as to plant a chair for her and the like: but it
never could come to more than that. The wives looked
on, and were civil and kind in a ladylike way to the
girl; but I guess she was too pretty to please them;
her looks and coquettish vivacity were too conquering;
whenever she spoke at table there was an eager sweep
of moustache, a universal rounding of Roman and other
noses in the direction of her chair. I don’t think the
wives liked it; but, as I have said, they were all very
kind in a genteel way.</p>

<p>I had made up my mind, judging from the glances
the girl had directed at the handsome mate Aiken in
dock, that she would, though perhaps without losing
her heart, yield to the influence of his manly beauty,
and be very willing to carry on an aimless flirtation
when I was out of sight and the man in charge of
the ship. I had also made up my mind, if I caught
the mate attempting to fool with the girl, to bring him
up with a “round turn.” In fact, I chose to be a taut
hand in those matters, quite irrespective of private
feelings. Apparently, however, I was to be spared the
trouble of bidding my handsome mate keep himself to
himself and his weather-eye lifting for the ship and his
duties only. Day after day passed, and I never caught
him speaking to her.</p>

<p>Once only, and this was at some early date, when
she and I were pacing the deck together, and Aiken was
standing at the head of the weather-poop ladder, she
asked me to tell her about him. Was he married? I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
said I believed not—I happened to <em>know</em> he was not.
Who and what was his father? How long had he been
at sea? When was he likely to get command? The
subject was then changed, and afterwards, though I
watched them somewhat jealously, I never detected so
much as a glance pass between them.</p>

<p>The long and short of it was—I am bound to confess
it—before we had struck the Canary parallels, I—myself—I—Captain
Cleaver, commander of the ship <i>Hecla</i>—was
seriously in love with the girl, and making my days
and nights uneasy by contemplation of a proposal of
marriage based on these considerations: first, that I
was in love with her; next, that she was not in love
with the Rev. Joseph Moxon; third, that I could give
her a home in England; and then, again, her father
was my friend, one of my own cloth, and I had no
doubt he would be delighted if I brought her home with
me as my wife.</p>

<p>No good, in a short yarn like this, to enter into the
question of what was due from me to Joseph Moxon.
Enough that I was in love with the girl, and that I had
quite clearly discovered she had no affection for—she
did not even like or respect—Joseph. I was eight-and-thirty
years of age, and a young man at that, as I chose
to think; yet somehow Miss Minnie, by no means
unintentionally, as I <em>now</em> know, contrived to keep
sentiment at bay by making me feel that in taking the
place of her father whilst we were at sea I had become
her father. Never by word of lip did I give her to know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
that I was in love with her; but I saw she was perfectly
sensible that I was her devoted admirer, and that
something was bound to happen before we should climb
very far north into the Indian Ocean.</p>

<p>One night at about eleven o’clock—six bells—I
stepped on deck from my cabin to take a look round.
The ship’s latitude was then about 25° south. It was
a cool, very quiet, dark night, with a piece of dusky-red
moon dying out bulbous and distorted in the liquid
blackness north-west; a few stars shone sparely; the
canvas rose pale and silent; saving the lift of the fabric
on the long-drawn heave of the swell, all the life in her
was in a little music of ripples, breaking from her stem
and tinkling aft in the noise of a summer shower upon
water.</p>

<p>I looked into the binnacle, and not immediately
seeing the officer of the watch, went a little way forward,
and perceived two figures to leeward standing against
the poop rail. I walked straight to them quickly. One
was Mr. Aiken and the other Miss Minnie Mills. She
laughed when I stepped up to her, and exclaimed, “No
scolding, I beg. I was disturbed by a nightmare, and
came on deck to see if I was really upon the ocean
instead of at Junglepore. Mr. Aiken has reassured
me. I shall be able to sleep now, I think. So good
night to you both,” and with that she left us and
disappeared.</p>

<p>I was angry, excited, exceedingly jealous. I guessed
I had been tricked, and that a deal had passed between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
these two, for many a long day gone, utterly unobserved
by me. I gave Mr. Aiken a piece of my mind.</p>

<p>Never had I “hazed” any man as I did that fellow
as he stood before me. He said it was not his fault;
the girl had come on deck and accosted him: he was no
ship’s constable to order the passengers about; if he
was spoken to, he answered; I expected he would be
civil to the passengers, he supposed.</p>

<p>I bestowed several sea blessings on his eyes and
limbs, and bade him understand that Miss Minnie Mills
was under my protection; if I caught him speaking to
her I would break him for insubordination. He was
mate of the ship, and his business lay in doing his duty.
If he went beyond it, he should sling his hammock in
the forecastle for the rest of the voyage.</p>

<p>I was horribly in earnest and angry; and when I
returned to my cabin, I paced the floor of it as sick at
heart as a jilted woman with jealousy and spleen.
However, after a while I contrived to console myself
with believing that their being together was an accident,
and that it might have been as Aiken had put it. At
all events, it made me somewhat easy to reflect that I
had never observed them in company before, never even
caught them looking at each other—that is, significantly.</p>

<p>She was in a sullen and pouting temper all next
day.</p>

<p>“Why mayn’t I go on deck at night if I choose?”
said she.</p>

<p>“Your father would object,” said I. “You are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
under my care. I am responsible for you,” I added,
with a tender look.</p>

<p>“Would you prohibit the other lady passengers from
going on deck at night?”</p>

<p>“You shall have your way in anything that is good
for you,” said I.</p>

<p>She flashed an arch, saucy glance at me, then
sighed, and seemed intensely miserable on a sudden.
I believe but for having caught her in Aiken’s company
I should then and there have offered her my hand.</p>

<p>For a week following she was so completely in the
dumps it was hard to get a word from her. Sometimes
she looked as if she had been secretly crying, yet I never
could persuade myself that the appearance her eyes
would at such times present was due to weeping. She
moped apart. Some of the passengers noticed her
behaviour and spoke to me about it, thinking she was
ill. The ship’s surgeon talked with her, and assured
me privately he could find nothing wrong save that she
complained of poorness of spirits.</p>

<p>“She seems to hate the idea of India,” said he,
“and wants to go home.”</p>

<p>And so she shall (thought I), but she must arrive
in India first, where she may leave it to me to square
the yards for her with the Reverend Joseph Moxon.</p>

<p>We blew westwards round the Cape before a strong
gale of wind. One morning, at the grey of dawn, I
was aroused by a knocking on my cabin door. The
second mate entered. He was a man named Wickham,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
a bullet-headed, immensely strong, active seaman, the
younger son of a baronet: he would have held command
at that time but for “the drink.” He grasped a woman’s
hat and handkerchief, and exclaimed—</p>

<p>“I’ve just found these in the port mizzen chains,
sir. I can’t tell how they happen to have come there.
It looks like mischief.”</p>

<p>I sprang from my cot partially clothed, as I invariably
was on turning in, and taking the hat in my
hand, and bringing it to the clearer light of the large
cabin window, I seemed to remember it as having been
worn by Minnie Mills. I snatched the handkerchief
from the man, and saw the initials M. M. marked upon
it. This sufficed. I swiftly and completely clothed
myself and entered the saloon.</p>

<p>My first act was to send the second mate for the
stewardess. The woman arrived out of the steerage,
where she slept. I said—speaking softly that the people
in the berths on either hand might not be disturbed—</p>

<p>“Go and look into Miss Mills’ cabin, and report to
me if all is well there.”</p>

<p>She went, vanished, was some little while out of
sight; then reappeared and approached me, pale in the
ashen light that was filtering through the skylights.</p>

<p>“Miss Mills’ cabin is empty, sir.”</p>

<p>I was prepared for this piece of news; yet my heart
beat with a fast sick pulse when, without speech, I
went to the girl’s berth, followed by the stewardess.
The bunk had been occupied—the bed-clothes lay tossed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
in it. My eye, travelling rapidly over the interior, was
quickly taken by a note lying upon a chest of drawers.
It was addressed to me, and ran thus:—</p>

<p>“I am weary of life, and have resolved to end it.
The thought of living even for a short while with Mr.
Moxon at Junglepore has broken my heart, and you
are as tyrannical and cruel to me as life itself. Farewell,
and thank you for such kindness as you have
shown me, and when you see my father tell him that
I died loving him and blessing him.”</p>

<p>“Good God! She’s committed suicide!” cried I.</p>

<p>The stewardess shrieked.</p>

<p>I felt mad with amazement and grief. I read and
re-read her letter, and then looked round the berth
again, wondering if this were not some practical joke
which she intended should be tragical by the fright it
excited. I then went to work to make inquiries. I
roused up Mr. Aiken, and, showing him the girl’s note,
asked him if he had seen her on deck during his watch—if
he himself had at any time foreboded this dreadful
thing—if he could help me with any suggestions or
information. He read the letter and stared blankly;
his handsome countenance was as pale as milk whilst he
eyed me. I seemed to find the ghastly mildness of a
dead man’s face in his looks. He had nothing to say.
No lady had come on deck in his watch. He had not
exchanged a sentence with Miss Mills since that night
when I threatened to break him if I found him in her
company.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>The men who had steered the ship throughout the
night were brought out of the forecastle: no man had
seen any lady jump overboard or slip into the mizzen-chains—not
likely! Wouldn’t the helmsman, seeing
such a thing, yell out?</p>

<p>The morning was now advanced. The passengers
came from their berths, and it was quickly known fore
and aft that the beautiful young girl who had been
moping apart for three weeks past as though slowly
going mad with melancholy had committed suicide by
jumping overboard. The doctor and I and the two
mates spent a long time whilst we overhung the mizzen-chains
in conjecturing how she had managed it. The
cabin windows were small: she had certainly never
squeezed her fine ripe figure through the porthole of
her berth; therefore she had come on to the poop in
some black hour of the night by way of the quarter-deck,
passing like a shadow to leeward till she arrived
at the mizzen-rigging, where the deep dye flung upon
the blackness by the mizzen—for it had been a quiet
night, the ship under all plain sail—completely shrouded
her. The rest would be easy, and if she dropped from
the chains, which, through the angle of the deck, were
depressed to within a few feet of the water, her fall
might have been almost soundless.</p>

<p>The blow to me was terrible, and for some days I
was prostrated. So unnecessary, I kept on saying to
myself. Good heavens! For weeks I had been on
the verge of proposing to her. The offer of my hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
would have saved her life. I could not reconcile so
enormous an act with the insignificance of the occasion
for it. Old Mills was no tyrant. He had not <em>driven</em>
her to India. She had consented—with an ill grace
perhaps, not caring for the man she was going to; but
there had been acquiescence on her part too, enough
of it, at all events, to make one wonder that she should
have destroyed herself. How should I be able to meet
the old captain? Where was I to find the spirit to
tell him the story?</p>

<p>The stewardess, to satisfy herself, thoroughly
searched the after part of the ship. It came to my
ears that she did not believe that the girl had committed
suicide, having neither cause nor courage for
such an act. She fancied that one or another of the
passengers had hidden her. But for what purpose?
The fool of a woman could not answer <em>that</em> when the
question was put to her. What end would the girl’s
hiding achieve? She was bound to come to light on
our arrival at Bombay. What motive, then, could she
have for concealing herself, for denying herself the
refreshment of the deck in the Indian Ocean, ultimately
to be shamefully revealed as an impostor capable of
the most purposeless and idiotic of deceits?</p>

<p>The beauty was overboard and dead, and my heart,
what with disappointed love and grieving for her and
sorrow for her poor old father, weighed as lead in me
when I thought of it.</p>

<p>We were within a fortnight’s sail of Bombay, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
there broke a dawn thick and dirty as smoke, with
masses of sooty vapour smouldering off the edge of the
sea in the west and darkening overhead till the trucks
faded out in the gloom. Yet the glass stood high, and
I made nothing of the mere appearance of this weather.
It lasted all day, with now and again a distant groan
of thunder. A weak, hot breeze held the canvas steady,
and the ship wrinkled onward, holding her course, but
sailing through a noon that was as evening for shadow.</p>

<p>We dined at seven. The deck was then in charge of
the second mate, Wickham. Before going below I told
him to keep a bright look-out, and took myself an
earnest view of the sea. The dusk lay very thick upon
the cold, greasy, gleaming surface of the ocean, there
was not a star overhead, and maybe a man would not
have been able to see a distance of half a dozen ship’s
lengths.</p>

<p>About the middle of dinner I heard a great bawling,
a loud and fearful crying out as for life or death. The
mate, Aiken, who sat at the foot of the long cuddy table,
caught the sound with a sailor’s ear as I did, and
sprang to his feet, and we rushed on deck together.
I had scarcely passed through the companion hatch
when the ship was struck. She heeled violently over,
listing on a sudden to an angle of nearly fifty degrees,
and a dismal, loud, general shriek rose through the
open skylight, accompanied by the crash of timber
overhead. Along with this went a wild hissing noise
and an extraordinary sound of throbbing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>I rushed to the side, and saw that a large steamer
had run into us. She was a big black paddle-boat, one
of the few large side-wheel steamers which formerly
traded betwixt England and the East Indies by way of
the Cape. The sky seemed charged with stars from the
spangles of fire which floated along with the thick smoke
from her chimney. She was full of light. Every cabin
window looked like the lens of a flaming bull’s-eye.</p>

<p>I sprang on to the rail, and, hailing the steamer,
asked him to keep his stem into us till we found out
what damage he had done, and then roared to the mate,
but obtained no reply. I yelled again, then shouted to
Wickham to tell the carpenter to sound the well. The
passengers came crowding on to the poop. I told them
there was no danger; that, though it should come to our
leaving the ship, the steamer would stand by us and
take all aboard.</p>

<p>The well was sounded, and two feet of water reported.
On this I instantly understood that the ship was doomed,
that to call the hands to the pumps would be to exhaust
them to no purpose; and, hailing the steamer afresh
as she lay hissing on our bow, with her looming stem-head
overshadowing our forecastle, I reported our condition,
and told him to stand-by to pick us up.</p>

<p>We immediately lowered the boats and sent away
the women and as many men as there was room for; a
second trip emptied the <i>Hecla</i> of her passengers. Meanwhile
the steamer, at my request, kept her bows right
into us. At this time there were seven feet of water in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
the hold. It was very black, and we worked with the help
of lanterns. The mate appeared amongst my people
now, and I asked him with an oath, out of the rage and
distress of that hour, where he had been skulking. He
answered, he was from the forecastle. I told him he
was a liar, and ordered him whilst the ship swam to
take a number of the hands into the cabin and save as
much of the passengers’ effects as they could come at.</p>

<p>Not much time was permitted for this: every minute
I seemed to feel the ship settling deeper and deeper with
a sickening, sullen lift of her whole figure to every
heave of the swell, as though she rose wearily to make
her farewell plunge. Now the vessels were disengaged,
and the steamer lay close abreast. I lingered, almost
heart-broken, scarcely yet realizing to its full height
this tragic disaster to my ship and my own fortunes;
and then, hearing them calling to me, I got into the
mizzen-chains, thinking, as I did so, of Minnie Mills,
wishing to God I was at rest and out of it all where she
lay, and entered one of the boats.</p>

<p>The commander of the steamer received me in the
gangway. The decks were light as noontide with
lanterns. He was a grey-haired man, tall and somewhat
stately, dressed in a uniform after the pattern of the
old East India Company’s service. When he understood
I was the captain he bowed, and said—</p>

<p>“It’s a terrible calamity, sir. I hope to live to see
the day when they will compel all masters, by Act of
Parliament, to show lights at sea at night.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>A lantern was sparkling on his fore-stay, but our
ship was without side-lights, and when I turned to look
at her the roar of her bursting decks came along in a
shock hard as a blow on the ear, and the whole pale
fabric of canvas melted out upon the black water as a
wreath of vapour dies in the breeze.</p>

<p>The steamer was the <i>Nourmahal</i>, Bulstrode commander.
She was half full of invalided soldiers and
other folks going home, and when our own people were
aboard she was an overloaded craft, humanly speaking;
but after a consultation with me the captain resolved to
proceed. He was flush with water and provisions, and
had the security besides of paddles, which slapped an
easy ten knots into the hull. And then, again, she lifted
the yards of a ship of twelve hundred tons, and showed
as big a topsail to the wind as a frigate’s.</p>

<p>All that could be done was done for us. Men turned
out of their cabins to accommodate the ladies and
children, and a cot was slung for me in the chief
officer’s berth. But I needed no pillow for my head
that first night. There was nothing in laudanum short
of a death-draught that could have given me sleep.</p>

<p>But to pass by my own state of mind, that came
very near to a suicidal posture. At eight bells next
morning, the mate whose cabin I shared stepped in and
exclaimed, “Did you know you had a woman dressed
up as a man amongst your passengers?”</p>

<p>“No!” I exclaimed, “not likely. I should not
permit such a thing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s so, then,” said he: “our doctor twigged her
at once, and handed her over to the stewardess, who
has berthed her aft. She’s a lady, and a devilish
pretty woman,—mighty pale, though, with a scared,
wild blind look, as though she had been dug up out
of darkness, and couldn’t get used to the light.”</p>

<p>“What name does she give?” said I.</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>I wished immediately to see her. An extraordinary
suspicion worked in my head. The mate told me she
was in the stewardess’s berth, and directed me to it. I
knocked. The stewardess opened the door, and I
immediately saw standing in the middle of the berth,
with her hands to her head, pinning a bronze tress to a
bed of glowing coils, Miss Minnie Mills!</p>

<p>I stared frantically, shouted “Good God!” and
rushed in. She screamed and shrank, then clasped her
hands, and reared herself loftily with a bringing of her
whole shape, so to speak, together.</p>

<p>“So,” said I, breathing short with astonishment
and twenty conflicting passions, “and this is how they
commit suicide in your country, hey?”</p>

<p>The stewardess enlarged her eyes.</p>

<p>“I don’t mean to marry Mr. Joseph Moxon,” said
the girl.</p>

<p>“In what part of the ship did you hide?” I exclaimed.</p>

<p>She made no answer.</p>

<p>“Was Mr. Aiken in the secret?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>Still no reply.</p>

<p>“Oh, but you should answer the captain, miss,”
cried the stewardess.</p>

<p>The girl burst into tears, and turned her back upon
me. I stepped out and asked for Captain Bulstrode.
He received me in his cabin, and then I told him the
story of Miss Minnie Mills.</p>

<p>“I never would take charge of a young lady,” said
he, half laughing, though he was a good deal astonished,
“after an experience I underwent in that way. I’ll tell
it you another time. Let’s send for your mate, and see
what he has to say for himself.”</p>

<p>Presently Mr. Aiken arrived. He was pale, but he
carried a lofty, independent air; the fact was, I was no
longer his captain. The ship was sunk, and Jack was
as good as his master. I requested, representing Captain
Mills as I did, that he would be candid with me, tell me
how it stood between him and Miss Mills, if he had
helped her in her plot of suicide, where he had hidden
her in the ship, and what he meant to do. I thought
Bulstrode looked at him with an approving eye. I am
bound to repeat he was an uncommonly handsome
fellow.</p>

<p>“Captain Cleaver,” he said, addressing me with a
very frank, straightforward face and air, “I am perfectly
aware that I have done wrong, sir. But the long and
short of it is, Miss Mills and I are in love with each
other, and we mean to get married.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you tell me so?” I said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>He looked at me knowingly. I felt myself colour.</p>

<p>“Well,” said I, “anyhow, it was so confoundedly
unnecessary, you know, for her to pretend to drown
herself, and for you to hold her in hiding.”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon—you made it rather necessary,
sir—you will remember that night——”</p>

<p>“So unnecessary!” I thundered out in a passion.</p>

<p>“Where did ye hide her?” said Captain Bulstrode.</p>

<p>“I decline to answer that question,” replied Aiken.</p>

<p>And the dog kept his word, for we never succeeded in
getting the truth out of him, or the girl either; though
if she did not lie secret in the blackness of the after-hold,
then I don’t know in what other part of the ship he
could have kept her: certainly not in his own cabin,
which the ship’s steward was in and out of often, nor in
any of the cuddy or steerage berths.</p>

<p>To end this: there was a clergyman in the ship;
and Bulstrode, who, without personal knowledge of
Captain Mills, had heard of him and respected him,
insisted upon the couple being married that same forenoon.
They were not loth, and, the parson consenting,
they were spliced in the presence of a full saloon. I
shook the girl by the hand when the business was over,
and wished her well; but from beginning to end it was
all so unnecessary!</p>

<h2 id="THE_MAJORS_COMMISSION"><i>THE MAJOR’S COMMISSION.</i></h2>

<p>My name is Henry Adams, and in 1854 I was mate of
a ship of 1200 tons named the <i>Jessamy Bride</i>. June
of that year found her at Calcutta with cargo to the
hatches, and ready to sail for England in three or four
days.</p>

<p>I was walking up and down the ship’s long quarter-deck,
sheltered by the awning, when a young apprentice
came aft and said a gentleman wished to speak to me.
I saw a man standing in the gangway; he was a tall,
soldierly person, about forty years of age, with iron-grey
hair and spiked moustache, and an aquiline nose. His
eyes were singularly bright and penetrating. He immediately
said—</p>

<p>“I wanted to see the captain; but as chief officer
you’ll do equally well. When does this ship sail?”</p>

<p>“On Saturday or Monday next.”</p>

<p>He ran his eye along the decks and then looked aloft:
there was something bird-like in the briskness of his
way of glancing.</p>

<p>“I understand you don’t carry passengers?”</p>

<p>“That’s so, sir, though there’s accommodation for
them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m out of sorts, and have been sick for months,
and want to see what a trip round the Cape to England
will do for me. I shall be going home, not for my
health only, but on a commission. The Maharajah of
Ratnagiri, hearing I was returning to England on sick-leave,
asked me to take charge of a very splendid gift
for Her Majesty the Queen of England. It is a diamond,
valued at fifteen thousand pounds.”</p>

<p>He paused to observe the effect of this communication,
and then proceeded—</p>

<p>“I suppose you know how the Koh-i-noor was sent
home?”</p>

<p>“It was conveyed to England, I think,” said I, “by
H.M.S. <i>Medea</i>, in 1850.”</p>

<p>“Yes; she sailed in April that year, and arrived at
Portsmouth in June. The glorious gem was intrusted
to Colonel Mackieson and Captain Ramsay. It was
locked up in a small box along with other jewels, and
each officer had a key. The box was secreted in the
ship by them, and no man on board the vessel, saving
themselves, knew where it was hidden.”</p>

<p>“Was that so?” said I, much interested.</p>

<p>“Yes; I had the particulars from the commander of
the vessel, Captain Lockyer. When do you expect your
skipper on board?” he exclaimed, darting a bright,
sharp look around him.</p>

<p>“I cannot tell. He may arrive at any moment.”</p>

<p>“The having charge of a stone valued at fifteen
thousand pounds, and intended as a gift for the Queen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
of England, is a deuce of a responsibility,” said he. “I
shall borrow a hint from the method adopted in the case
of the Koh-i-noor. I intend to hide the stone in my
cabin, so as to extinguish all risk, saving, of course,
what the insurance people call the act of God. May
I look at your cabin accommodation?”</p>

<p>“Certainly.”</p>

<p>I led the way to the companion hatch, and he
followed me into the cabin. The ship had berthing
room for eight or ten people irrespective of the officers
who slept aft. But the vessel made no bid for passengers.
She left them to Blackwall liners, to the splendid
ships of Green, Money Wigram, and Smith, and to the
P. &amp; O. and other steam lines. The overland route was
then the general choice; few of their own decision went
by way of the Cape. No one had booked with us down
to this hour, and we had counted upon having the cabin
to ourselves.</p>

<p>The visitor walked into every empty berth, and
inspected it as carefully as though he had been a
Government surveyor. He beat upon the walls and
bulkheads with his cane, sent his brilliant gaze into the
corners and under the bunks and up at the ceiling, and
finally said, as he stepped from the last of the visitable
cabins—</p>

<p>“This decides me. I shall sail with you.”</p>

<p>I bowed and said I was sure the captain would be
glad of the pleasure of his company.</p>

<p>“I presume,” said he, “that no objection will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
raised to my bringing a native carpenter aboard to
construct a secret place, as in the case of the Koh-i-noor,
for the Maharajah’s diamond?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think a native carpenter would be allowed
to knock the ship about,” said I.</p>

<p>“Certainly not. A little secret receptacle—big
enough to receive this,” said he, putting his hand in
his side pocket and producing a square Morocco case,
of a size to berth a bracelet or a large brooch. “The
construction of a nook to conceal this will not be knocking
your ship about?”</p>

<p>“It’s a question for the captain and the agents,
sir,” said I.</p>

<p>He replaced the case, whose bulk was so inconsiderable
that it did not bulge in his coat when he
had pocketed it, and said, now that he had inspected
the ship and the accommodation, he would call at once
upon the agents. He gave me his card and left the
vessel.</p>

<p>The card bore the name of a military officer of some
distinction. Enough if, in this narrative of a memorable
and extraordinary incident, I speak of him as
Major Byron Hood.</p>

<p>The master of the <i>Jessamy Bride</i> was Captain Robert
North. This man had, three years earlier, sailed with
me as my chief mate; it then happened I was unable
to quickly obtain command, and accepted the offer of
mate of the <i>Jessamy Bride</i>, whose captain, I was
surprised to hear, proved the shipmate who had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
under me, but who, some money having been left to
him, had purchased an interest in the firm to which
the ship belonged. We were on excellent terms; almost
as brothers, indeed. He never asserted his authority,
and left it to my own judgment to recognize his claims.
I am happy to know he had never occasion to regret
his friendly treatment of me.</p>

<p>He came on board in the afternoon of that day on
which Major Hood had visited the ship, and was full
of that gentleman and his resolution to carry a costly
diamond round the Cape under sail, instead of making
his obligation as brief as steam and the old desert
route would allow.</p>

<p>“I’ve had a long talk with him up at the agents’,”
said Captain North. “He don’t seem well.”</p>

<p>“Suffering from his nerves, perhaps,” said I.</p>

<p>“He’s a fine, gentlemanly person. He told Mr.
Nicholson he was twice wounded, naming towns which
no Christian man could twist his tongue into the
sound of.”</p>

<p>“Will he be allowed to make a hole in the ship to
hide his diamond in?”</p>

<p>“He has agreed to make good any damage done,
and to pay at the rate of a fare and a half for the
privilege of hiding the stone.”</p>

<p>“Why doesn’t he give the thing into your keeping,
sir? This jackdaw-like hiding is a sort of reflection on
our honesty, isn’t it, captain?”</p>

<p>He laughed and answered, “No; I like such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
reflections, for my part. Who wants to be burdened
with the custody of precious things belonging to other
people? Since he’s to have the honour of presenting
the diamond, let the worry of taking care of it be his;
this ship’s enough for me.”</p>

<p>“He’ll be knighted, I suppose, for delivering this
stone,” said I. “Did he show it to you, sir?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“He has it in his pocket.”</p>

<p>“He produced the case,” said Captain North. “A
thing about the size of a muffin. Where’ll he hide it?
But we’re not to be curious in <em>that</em> direction,” he added,
smiling.</p>

<p>Next morning, somewhere about ten o’clock, Major
Hood came on board with two natives; one a carpenter,
the other his assistant. They brought a basket of
tools, descended into the cabin, and were lost sight of
till after two. No; I’m wrong. I was writing at the
cabin table at half-past twelve when the Major opened
his door, peered out, shut the door swiftly behind him
with an extraordinary air and face of caution and
anxiety, and, coming along to me, asked for some refreshments
for himself and the two natives. I called
to the steward, who filled a tray, which the Major with
his own hands conveyed into his berth. Then, some
time after two, whilst I was at the gangway talking to
a friend, the Major and the two blacks came out of
the cabin. Before they went over the side I said—</p>

<p>“Is the work finished below, sir?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>“It is, and to my entire satisfaction,” he answered.</p>

<p>When he was gone, my friend, who was the master
of a barque, asked me who that fine-looking man was.
I answered he was a passenger, and then, not understanding
that the thing was a secret, plainly told him
what they had been doing in the cabin, and why.</p>

<p>“But,” said he, “those two niggers’ll know that
something precious is to be hidden in the place they’ve
been making.”</p>

<p>“That’s been in my head all the morning,” said I.</p>

<p>“Who’s to hinder them,” said he, “from blabbing
to one or more of the crew? Treachey’s cheap in this
country. A rupee will buy a pile of roguery.” He
looked at me expressively. “Keep a bright look-out
for a brace of well-oiled stowaways,” said he.</p>

<p>“It’s the Major’s business,” I answered, with a
shrug.</p>

<p>When Captain North came on board, he and I went
into the Major’s berth. We scrutinized every part, but
saw nothing to indicate that a tool had been used or
a plank lifted. There was no sawdust, no chip of wood:
everything to the eye was precisely as before. No man
will say we had not a right to look: how were we to
make sure, as captain and mate of the ship for whose
safety we were responsible, that those blacks under the
eye of the Major had not been doing something which
might give us trouble by-and-by?</p>

<p>“Well,” said Captain North, as we stepped on deck,
“if the diamond’s already hidden, which I doubt, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
couldn’t be more snugly concealed if it were twenty
fathoms deep in the mud here.”</p>

<p>The Major’s baggage came on board on the Saturday,
and on the Monday we sailed. We were twenty-four
of a ship’s company all told: twenty-five souls in all,
with Major Hood. Our second mate was a man named
Mackenzie, to whom and to the apprentices whilst we
lay in the river I had given particular instructions to
keep a sharp look-out on all strangers coming aboard.
I had been very vigilant myself too, and altogether was
quite convinced there was no stowaway below, either
white or black, though under ordinary circumstances
one never would think of seeking for a native in hiding
for Europe.</p>

<p>On either hand of the <i>Jessamy Bride’s</i> cabin five
sleeping-berths were bulkheaded off. The Major’s was
right aft on the starboard side. Mine was next his.
The captain occupied a berth corresponding with the
Major’s, right aft on the port side. Our solitary
passenger was exceedingly amiable and agreeable at
the start and for days after. He professed himself
delighted with the cabin fare, and said it was not to
be bettered at three times the charge in the saloons of
the steamers. His drink he had himself laid in: it
consisted mainly of claret and soda. He had come
aboard with a large cargo of Indian cigars, and was
never without a long, black weed, bearing some tongue-staggering,
up-country name, betwixt his lips. He was
primed with professional anecdote, had a thorough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
knowledge of life in India, both in the towns and wilds,
had seen service in Burmah and China, and was
altogether one of the most conversible soldiers I ever
met: a scholar, something of a wit, and all that he
said and all that he did was rendered the more engaging
by grace of breeding.</p>

<p>Captain North declared to me he had never met so
delightful a man in all his life, and the pleasantest
hours I ever passed on the ocean were spent in walking
the deck in conversation with Major Byron Hood.</p>

<p>For some days after we were at sea no reference
was made either by the Major or ourselves to the
Maharajah of Ratnagiri’s splendid gift to Her Majesty
the Queen. The captain and I and Mackenzie viewed
it as tabooed matter: a thing to be locked up in
memory, just as, in fact, it was hidden away in some
cunningly-wrought receptacle in the Major’s cabin.
One day at dinner, however, when we were about a
week out from Calcutta, Major Hood spoke of the
Maharajah’s gift. He talked freely about it; his face,
was flushed as though the mere thought of the thing
raised a passion of triumph in his spirits. His eyes
shone whilst he enlarged upon the beauty and value
of the stone.</p>

<p>The captain and I exchanged looks; the steward
was waiting upon us with cocked ears, and that menial,
deaf expression of face which makes you know every
word is being greedily listened to. We might therefore
make sure that before the first dog-watch came round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
all hands would have heard that the Major had a
diamond in his cabin intended for the Queen of England,
and worth fifteen thousand pounds. Nay, they’d
hear even more than that; for in the course of his talk
about the gem the Major praised the ingenuity of the
Asiatic artisan, whether Indian or Chinese, and spoke
of the hiding-place the two natives had contrived for the
diamond as an example of that sort of juggling skill in
carving which is found in perfection amongst the
Japanese.</p>

<p>I thought this candour highly indiscreet: charged
too with menace. A matter gains in significance by
mystery. The Jacks would think nothing of a diamond
being in the ship as a part of her cargo, which might
include a quantity of specie for all they knew. But
some of them might think more often about it than was
at all desirable when they understood it was stowed
away under a plank, or was to be got by tapping about
for a hollow echo, or probing with the judgment of a
carpenter when the Major was on deck and the coast aft
all clear.</p>

<p>We had been three weeks at sea; it was a roasting
afternoon, though I cannot exactly remember the
situation of the ship. Our tacks were aboard and the
bowlines triced out, and the vessel was scarcely looking
up to her course, slightly heeling away from a fiery
fanning of wind off the starboard bow, with the sea
trembling under the sun in white-hot needles of broken
light, and a narrow ribbon of wake glancing off into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
hot blue thickness that brought the horizon within a
mile of us astern.</p>

<p>I had charge of the deck from twelve to four. For
an hour past the Major, cigar in mouth, had been
stretched at his ease in a folding chair; a book lay
beside him on the skylight, but he scarcely glanced at
it. I had paused to address him once or twice, but he
showed no disposition to chat. Though he lay in the
most easy lounging posture imaginable, I observed a
restless, singular expression in his face, accentuated yet
by the looks he incessantly directed out to sea, or
glances at the deck forward, or around at the helm, so
far as he might move his head without shifting his
attitude. It was as though his mind were in labour
with some scheme. A man might so look whilst working
out the complicated plot of a play, or adjusting by
the exertion of his memory the intricacies of a novel
piece of mechanism.</p>

<p>On a sudden he started up and went below.</p>

<p>A few minutes after he had left the deck, Captain
North came up from his cabin, and for some while we
paced the planks together. There was a pleasant hush
upon the ship; the silence was as refreshing as a fold
of coolness lifting off the sea. A spun-yarn winch was
clinking on the forecastle; from alongside rose the
music of fretted waters.</p>

<p>I was talking to the captain on some detail of the
ship’s furniture, when Major Hood came running up the
companion steps, his face as white as his waistcoat, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
head uncovered, every muscle of his countenance rigid,
as with horror.</p>

<p>“Good God, captain!” cried he, standing in the
companion, “what do you think has happened?”
Before we could fetch a breath he cried, “Some one’s
stolen the diamond!”</p>

<p>I glanced at the helmsman, who stood at the radiant
circle of wheel staring with open mouth and eyebrows
arched into his hair. The captain, stepping close to
Major Hood, said in a low, steady voice—</p>

<p>“What’s this you tell me, sir?”</p>

<p>“The diamond’s gone!” exclaimed the Major, fixing
his shining eyes upon me, whilst I observed that his
fingers convulsively stroked his thumbs as though he
were rolling up pellets of bread or paper.</p>

<p>“Do you tell me the diamond’s been taken from the
place you hid it in?” said Captain North, still speaking
softly, but with deliberation.</p>

<p>“The diamond never was hidden,” replied the Major,
who continued to stare at me. “It was in a portmanteau.
<em>That’s</em> no hiding-place!”</p>

<p>Captain North fell back a step. “Never was
hidden!” he exclaimed. “Didn’t you bring two native
workmen aboard for no other purpose than to hide it?”</p>

<p>“It never was hidden,” said the Major, now turning
his eyes upon the captain. “I chose it should be
believed it was undiscoverably concealed in some part
of my cabin, that I might safely and conveniently keep
it in my baggage, where no thief would dream of looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
for it. Who has it?” he cried with a sudden fierceness,
making a step full of passion out of the companion-way;
and he looked with knitted brows towards the ship’s
forecastle.</p>

<p>Captain North watched him idly for a moment or
two; and then, with an abrupt swing of his whole figure,
eloquent of defiant resolution, he stared the Major in the
face, and said in a quiet, level voice—</p>

<p>“I shan’t be able to help you. If it’s gone, it’s
gone. A diamond’s not a bale of wool. Whoever’s
been clever enough to find it will know how to keep it.”</p>

<p>“I must have it!” broke out the Major. “It’s a
gift for Her Majesty the Queen. It’s in this ship. I
look to you, sir, as master of this vessel, to recover the
property which some one of the people under your
charge has robbed me of!”</p>

<p>“I’ll accompany you to your cabin,” said the captain;
and they went down the steps.</p>

<p>I stood motionless, gaping like an idiot into the
yawn of hatch down which they had disappeared. I had
been so used to think of the diamond as cunningly
hidden in the Major’s berth, that his disclosure was
absolutely a shock with its weight of astonishment.
Small wonder that neither Captain North nor I had
observed any marks of a workman’s tools in the Major’s
berth. Not but that it was a very ingenious stratagem,
far cleverer to my way of thinking than any subtle,
secret burial of the thing. To think of the Major and
his two Indians sitting idly for hours in that cabin, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
the captain and myself all the while supposing they
were fashioning some wonderful contrivance or place
for concealing the treasure in! And still, for all the
Major’s cunning, the stone was gone! Who had stolen
it? The only fellow likely to prove the thief was the
steward, not because he was more or less of a rogue
than any other man in the ship, but because he was the
one person who, by virtue of his office, was privileged
to go in and out of the sleeping-places as his duties
required.</p>

<p>I was pacing the deck, musing into a sheer muddle
this singular business of the Maharajah of Ratnagiri’s
gift to the Queen of England, with all sorts of dim,
unformed suspicions floating loose in my brains round
the central fancy of the fifteen thousand pound stone
there, when the captain returned. He was alone. He
stepped up to me hastily, and said—</p>

<p>“He swears the diamond has been stolen. He
showed me the empty case.”</p>

<p>“Was there ever a stone in it at all?” said I.</p>

<p>“I don’t think that,” he answered quickly; “there’s
no motive under Heaven to be imagined if the whole
thing’s a fabrication.”</p>

<p>“What then, sir?”</p>

<p>“The case is empty, but I’ve not made up my mind
yet that the stone’s missing.”</p>

<p>“The man’s an officer and a gentleman.”</p>

<p>“I know, I know!” he interrupted, “but still, in
my opinion, the stone’s not missing. The long and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
short of it is,” he said, after a very short pause, with a
careful glance at the skylight and companion hatch,
“his behaviour isn’t convincing enough. Something’s
wanting in his passion and his vexation.”</p>

<p>“Sincerity!”</p>

<p>“Ah! I don’t intend that this business shall trouble
me. He angrily required me to search the ship for
stowaways. Bosh! The second mate and steward
have repeatedly overhauled the lazarette: there’s nobody
there.”</p>

<p>“And if not there, then nowhere else,” said I.
“Perhaps he’s got the fore-peak in his head.”</p>

<p>“I’ll not have a hatch lifted!” he exclaimed warmly;
“nor will I allow the crew to be troubled. There’s
been no theft. Put it that the stone is stolen. Who’s
going to find it in a forecastle full of men—a thing as
big as half a bean, perhaps? If it’s gone, it’s gone,
indeed, whoever may have it. But there’s no go in this
matter at all,” he added, with a short, nervous laugh.</p>

<p>We were talking in this fashion when the Major
joined us; his features were now composed. He gazed
sternly at the captain and said loftily—</p>

<p>“What steps are you prepared to take in this
matter?”</p>

<p>“None, sir.”</p>

<p>His face darkened. He looked with a bright gleam
in his eyes at the captain, then at me: his gaze was
piercing with the light in it. Without a word he stepped
to the side and, folding his arms, stood motionless.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>I glanced at the captain; there was something in
the bearing of the Major that gave shape, vague indeed,
to a suspicion that had cloudily hovered about my
thoughts of the man for some time past. The captain
met my glance, but he did not interpret it.</p>

<p>When I was relieved at four o’clock by the second
mate, I entered my berth, and presently, hearing the
captain go to his cabin, went to him and made a proposal.
He reflected, and then answered—</p>

<p>“Yes; get it done.”</p>

<p>After some talk, I went forward and told the
carpenter to step aft and bore a hole in the bulkhead
that separated the Major’s berth from mine. He took
the necessary tools from his chest and followed me.
The captain was now again on deck, talking with
the Major; in fact, detaining him in conversation, as
had been preconcerted. I went into the Major’s berth,
and quickly settled upon a spot for an eye-hole. The
carpenter then went to work in my cabin, and in a
few minutes bored an orifice large enough to enable me
to command a large portion of the adjacent interior. I
swept the sawdust from the deck in the Major’s berth,
so that no hint should draw his attention to the hole,
which was pierced in a corner shadowed by a shelf. I
then told the carpenter to manufacture a plug and paint
its extremity of the colour of the bulkhead. He brought
me this plug in a quarter of an hour. It fitted nicely,
and was to be withdrawn and inserted as noiselessly as
though greased.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>I don’t want you to suppose this Peeping-Tom
scheme was at all to my taste, albeit my own proposal;
but the truth is, the Major’s telling us that some one
had stolen his diamond made all who lived aft hotly
eager to find out whether he spoke the truth or not;
for, if he had been really robbed of the stone, then suspicion
properly rested upon the officers and the steward,
which was an <em>infernal</em> consideration: dishonouring and
inflaming enough to drive one to seek a remedy in even
a baser device than that of secretly keeping watch on a
man in his bedroom. Then, again, the captain told me
that the Major, whilst they talked when the carpenter
was at work making the hole, had said he would give
notice of his loss to the police at Capetown (at which
place we were to touch), and declared he’d take care no
man went ashore—from Captain North himself down to
the youngest apprentice—till every individual, every sea-chest,
every locker, drawer, shelf and box, bunk, bracket
and crevice, had been searched by qualified rummagers.</p>

<p>On this the day of the theft, nothing more was said
about the diamond: that is, after the captain had emphatically
informed Major Hood that he meant to take
no steps whatever in the matter. I had expected to
find the Major sullen and silent at dinner; he was not,
indeed, so talkative as usual, but no man watching and
hearing him would have supposed so heavy a loss as
that of a stone worth fifteen thousand pounds, the gift
of an Eastern potentate to the Queen of England, was
weighing upon his spirits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>It is with reluctance I tell you that, after dinner
that day, when he went to his cabin, I softly withdrew
the plug and watched him. I blushed whilst thus
acting, yet I was determined, for my own sake and for
the sake of my shipmates, to persevere. I spied nothing
noticeable saving this: he sat in a folding chair and
smoked, but every now and again he withdrew his cigar
from his mouth and talked to it with a singular smile.
It was a smile of cunning, that worked like some baleful,
magical spirit in the fine high breeding of his
features; changing his looks just as a painter of incomparable
skill might colour a noble, familiar face into
a diabolical expression, amazing those who knew it
only in its honest and manly beauty. I had never seen
that wild, grinning countenance on him before, and it
was rendered the more remarkable by the movement of
his lips whilst he talked to himself, but inaudibly.</p>

<p>A week slipped by. Time after time I had the man
under observation; often when I had charge of the deck
I’d leave the captain to keep a look-out, and steal below
and watch Major Hood in his cabin.</p>

<p>It was a Sunday, I remember. I was lying in my
bunk half dozing—we were then, I think, about a three-weeks’
sail from Table Bay—when I heard the Major go
to his cabin. I was already sick of my aimless prying;
and whilst I now lay I thought to myself, “I’ll sleep;
what is the good of this trouble? I know exactly what
I shall see. He is either in his chair, or his bunk, or
overhauling his clothes, or standing, cigar in mouth, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
the open porthole.” And then I said to myself, “If I
don’t look now I shall miss the only opportunity of
detection that may occur.” One is often urged by a
sort of instinct in these matters.</p>

<p>I got up, almost as through an impulse of habit,
noiselessly withdrew the plug, and looked. The Major
was at that instant standing with a pistol-case in his
hand: he opened it as my sight went to him, took out
one of a brace of very elegant pistols, put down the
case, and on his apparently touching a spring in the
butt of the pistol, the silver plate that ornamented
the extremity sprang open as the lid of a snuff-box
would, and something small and bright dropped into
his hand. This he examined with the peculiar cunning
smile I have before described; but, owing to the position
of his hand, I could not see what he held, though I had
not the least doubt that it was the diamond.</p>

<p>I watched him breathlessly. After a few minutes
he dropped the stone into the hollow butt-end, shut the
silver plate, shook the weapon against his ear as though
it pleased him to rattle the stone, then put it in its case,
and the case into a portmanteau.</p>

<p>I at once went on deck, where I found the captain,
and reported to him what I had seen. He viewed me in
silence, with a stare of astonishment and incredulity.
What I had seen, he said, was not the diamond. I told
him the thing that had dropped into the Major’s hand
was bright, and, as I thought, sparkled, but it was so
held I could not see it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>I was talking to him on this extraordinary affair when
the Major came on deck. The captain said to me,
“Hold him in chat. I’ll judge for myself,” and asked
me to describe how he might quickly find the pistol-case.
This I did, and he went below.</p>

<p>I joined the Major, and talked on the first subjects
that entered my head. He was restless in his manner,
inattentive, slightly flushed in the face; wore a lofty
manner, and being half a head taller than I, glanced
down at me from time to time in a condescending way.
This behaviour in him was what Captain North and I
had agreed to call his “injured air.” He’d occasionally
put it on to remind us that he was affronted by the
captain’s insensibility to his loss, and that the assistance
of the police would be demanded on our arrival at
Capetown.</p>

<p>Presently looking down the skylight, I perceived
the captain. Mackenzie had charge of the watch. I
descended the steps, and Captain North’s first words
to me were—</p>

<p>“It’s no diamond!”</p>

<p>“What, then, is it?”</p>

<p>“A common piece of glass not worth a quarter of a
farthing.”</p>

<p>“What’s it all about, then?” said I. “Upon my
soul, there’s nothing in Euclid to beat it. Glass?”</p>

<p>“A little lump of common glass; a fragment of
bull’s-eye, perhaps.”</p>

<p>“What’s he hiding it for?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>“Because,” said Captain North, in a soft voice
looking up and around, “he’s mad!”</p>

<p>“Just so!” said I. “That I’ll swear to <em>now</em>, and
I’ve been suspecting it this fortnight past.”</p>

<p>“He’s under the spell of some sort of mania,” continued
the captain; “he believes he’s commissioned to
present a diamond to the Queen; possibly picked up a
bit of stuff in the street that started the delusion, then
bought a case for it, and worked out the rest as we
know.”</p>

<p>“But why does he want to pretend that the stone
was stolen from him?”</p>

<p>“He’s been mastered by his own love for the
diamond,” he answered. “That’s how I reason it.
Madness has made his affection for his imaginary gem
a passion in him.”</p>

<p>“And so he robbed himself of it, you think, that he
might keep it?”</p>

<p>“That’s about it,” said he.</p>

<p>After this I kept no further look-out upon the Major,
nor would I ever take an opportunity to enter his cabin
to view for myself the piece of glass as the captain
described it, though curiosity was often hot in me.</p>

<p>We arrived at Table Bay in twenty-two days from
the date of my seeing the Major with the pistol in his
hand. His manner had for a week before been marked
by an irritability that was often beyond his control.
He had talked snappishly and petulantly at table, contradicted
aggressively, and on two occasions he gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
Captain North the lie; but we had carefully avoided
noticing his manner, and acted as though he were still
the high-bred, polished gentleman who had sailed with
us from Calcutta.</p>

<p>The first to come aboard were the Customs people.
They were almost immediately followed by the harbour-master.
Scarcely had the first of the Custom House
officers stepped over the side when Major Hood, with
a very red face, and a lofty, dignified carriage, marched
up to him, and said in a loud voice—</p>

<p>“I have been robbed during the passage from
Calcutta of a diamond worth fifteen thousand pounds,
which I was bearing as a gift from the Maharajah of
Ratnagiri to Her Majesty the Queen of England.”</p>

<p>The Customs man stared with a lobster-like expression
of face: no image could better hit the protruding
eyes and brick-red countenance of the man.</p>

<p>“I request,” continued the Major, raising his voice
into a shout, “to be placed at once in communication
with the police of this port. No person must be allowed
to leave the vessel until he has been thoroughly searched
by such expert hands as you and your <i lang="fr">confrères</i> no doubt
are, sir. I am Major Byron Hood. I have been twice
wounded. My services are well known, and, I believe,
duly appreciated in the right quarters. Her Majesty
the Queen is not to suffer any disappointment at the
hands of one who has the honour of wearing her uniform,
nor am I to be compelled, by the act of a thief, to betray
the confidence the Maharajah has reposed in me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>He continued to harangue in this manner for some
minutes, during which I observed a change in the
expression of the Custom House officers’ faces.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Captain North stood apart in earnest
conversation with the harbour-master. They now
approached; the harbour-master, looking steadily at
the Major, exclaimed—</p>

<p>“Good news, sir! Your diamond is found!”</p>

<p>“Ha!” shouted the Major. “Who has it?”</p>

<p>“You’ll find it in your pistol-case,” said the harbour-master.</p>

<p>The Major gazed round at us with his wild, bright
eyes, his face a-work with the conflict of twenty mad
passions and sensations. Then bursting into a loud,
insane laugh, he caught the harbour-master by the arm,
and in a low voice and a sickening, transforming leer
of cunning, said, “Come, let’s go and look at it.”</p>

<p>We went below. We were six, including two Custom
House officers. We followed the poor madman, who
grasped the harbour-master’s arm, and on arriving at
his cabin we stood at the door of it. He seemed heedless
of our presence, but on his taking the pistol-case from
the portmanteau, the two Customs men sprang forward.</p>

<p>“That must be searched by us,” one cried, and in
a minute they had it.</p>

<p>With the swiftness of experienced hands they found
and pressed the spring of the pistol, the silver plate
flew open, and out dropped a fragment of thick, common
glass, just as Captain North had described the thing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
It fell upon the deck. The Major sprang, picked it up
and pocketed it.</p>

<p>“Her Majesty will not be disappointed, after all,”
said he, with a courtly bow to us, “and the commission
the Maharajah’s honoured me with shall be fulfilled.”</p>

<p class="tb">The poor gentleman was taken ashore that afternoon,
and his luggage followed him. He was certified mad by
the medical man at Capetown, and was to be retained
there, as I understood, till the arrival of a steamer for
England. It was an odd, bewildering incident from top
to bottom. No doubt this particular delusion was
occasioned by the poor fellow, whose mind was then
fast decaying, reading about the transmission of the
Koh-i-noor, and musing about it with a madman’s
proneness to dwell upon little things.</p>

<h2 id="A_NIGHTMARE_OF_THE_DOLDRUMS"><i>A NIGHTMARE OF THE DOLDRUMS.</i></h2>

<p>The <i>Justitia</i> was a smart little barque of 395 tons. I
had viewed her with something of admiration as she lay
in mid-stream in the Hooghly—somewhere off the Coolie
Bazaar, I think it was. There was steam then coming
to Calcutta, though not as steam now is; very little of
it was in any sense palatial, and some of the very best
of it was to be as promptly distanced under given
conditions of weather by certain of the clippers, clouded
with studding-sails and flying-kites to the starry buttons
of their skysail mastheads, as the six-knot ocean tramp
of to-day is to be outrun by the four-masted leviathan
thrashing through it to windward with her yards fore
and aft.</p>

<p>I—representing in those days a large Birmingham
firm of dealers in the fal-lal industries—had wished to
make my way from Calcutta to Capetown. I saw the
<i>Justitia</i> and took a fancy to her; I admired the long,
low, piratic run of her hull as she lay with straining
hawsepipes on the rushing stream of the Hooghly;
upon which, as you watched, there might go by in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
space of an hour some half-score at least of dead
natives made ghastly canoes of by huge birds, erect
upon the corpses, burying their beaks as they sailed
along.</p>

<p>I found out that the <i>Justitia</i> was one of the smartest
of the Thames and East India traders of that time,
memorable on one occasion for having reeled off a clean
seventeen knots by the log under a main topgallant-sail,
set over a single-reefed topsail. It was murmured,
indeed, that the mate who hove that log was drunk when
he counted the knots; yet the dead reckoning tallied
with the next day’s observations. I called upon the
agents, was told that the <i>Justitia</i> was not a passenger
ship, but that I could hire a cabin for the run to Capetown
if I chose; a sum in rupees, trifling compared with
the cost of transit by steam, was named. I went on
board, found the captain walking up and down under
the awning, and agreeably killed an hour in a chat with
as amiable a seaman as ever it was my good fortune
to meet.</p>

<p>We sailed in the middle of July. Nothing worth
talking about happened during our run down the Bay
of Bengal. The crew aforemast were all of them
Englishmen; there were twelve, counting the cook and
steward. The captain was a man named Cayzer; the
only mate of the vessel was one William Perkins. The
boatswain, a rough, short, hairy, immensely strong man,
acted as second mate and kept a look-out when Perkins
was below. But he was entirely ignorant of navigation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
and owned to me that he read with difficulty words of
one syllable, and could not write.</p>

<p>I was the only passenger. My name, I may as well
say here, is Thomas Barron. Our run to the south
Ceylon parallels was slow and disappointing. The
monsoon was light and treacherous, sometimes dying
out in a sort of laughing, mocking gust till the whole
ocean was a sheet-calm surface, as though the dependable
trade wind was never again to blow.</p>

<p>“Oh yes,” said Captain Cayzer to me, “we’re used
to the unexpected hereabouts. Monsoon or no monsoon,
I’ll tell you what: you’re always safe in standing by
for an Irishman’s hurricane down here.”</p>

<p>“And what sort of breeze is that?” I asked.</p>

<p>“An up-and-down calm,” said he; “as hard
to know where it begins as to guess where it’ll
end.”</p>

<p>However, thanks to the frequent trade puffs and
other winds, which tasted not like the monsoon, we
crawled through those latitudes which Ceylon spans, and
fetched within a few degrees of the equator. In this
part of the waters we were to be thankful for even the
most trifling donation of catspaw, or for the equally
small and short-lived mercy of the gust of the electric
cloud. I forget how many days we were out from
Calcutta: the matter is of no moment. I left my cabin
one morning some hour after the sun had risen, by
which time the decks had been washed down, and were
already dry, with a salt sparkle as of bright white sand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
on the face of the planks, so roasting was it. I went
into the head to get a bath under the pump there. I
feel in memory, as I write, the exquisite sensation of
that luxury of brilliant brine, cold as snow, melting
through me from head to foot to the nimble plying of
the pump-brake by a seaman.</p>

<p>It was a true tropic morning. The sea, of a pale
lilac, flowed in a long-drawn, gentle heave of swell into
the south-west; the glare of the early morning brooded
in a sort of steamy whiteness in the atmosphere; the
sea went working to its distant reaches, and floated into
a dim blending of liquid air and water, so that you
couldn’t tell where the sky ended; a weak, hot wind
blew over the taffrail, but it was without weight. The
courses swung to the swell without response to the
breathings of the air; and on high the light cotton-white
royals were scarcely curved by the delicate passage
of the draught.</p>

<p>Yet the barque had steerage way. When I looked
through the grating at her metalled forefoot I saw the
ripples plentiful as harp strings threading aft, and whilst
I dried myself I watched the slow approach of a piece of
timber hoary with barnacles, and venerable with long
hairs of seaweed, amid and around which a thousand
little fish were sporting, many-coloured as though a
rainbow had been shivered.</p>

<p>I returned to my cabin, dressed, and stepped on to
the quarter-deck, where I found some men spreading
the awning, and the captain in a white straw hat viewing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
an object out upon the water through a telescope, and
talking to the boatswain, who stood alongside.</p>

<p>“What do you see?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Something that resembles a raft,” answered the
captain.</p>

<p>The thing he looked at was about a mile distant,
some three points on the starboard bow. On pointing
the telescope, I distinctly made out the fabric of a raft,
fitted with a short mast, to which midway a bundle—it
resembled a parcel—was attached. A portion of the
raft was covered by a white sheet or cloth, whence
dangled a short length of something chocolate-coloured,
indistinguishable even with the glass, lifting and sinking
as the raft rose and fell upon the flowing heave of
the sea.</p>

<p>“This ocean,” said the captain, taking the glass
from me, “is a big volume of tragic stories, and the
artist who illustrates the book does it in that fashion,”
and he nodded in the direction of the raft.</p>

<p>“What do you make of it, boatswain?” I asked.</p>

<p>“It looks to me,” he answered in his strong, harsh,
deep voice, “like a religious job—one of them rafts the
Burmah covies float away their dead on. I never see
one afore, sir, but I’ve heard tell of such things.”</p>

<p>We sneaked stealthily towards the raft. It was
seven bells—half-past seven—and the sailors ate their
breakfast on the forecastle, that they might view the
strange contrivance. The mate, Mr. Perkins, came on
deck to relieve the boatswain, and, after inspecting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
raft through the telescope, gave it as his opinion that it
was a Malay floating bier—“a Mussulman trick of ocean
burial, anyhow,” said he. “There should be a jar of
water aboard the raft, and cakes and fruit for the corpse
to regale on, if he ha’n’t been dead long.”</p>

<p>The steward announced breakfast; the captain told
him to hold it back awhile. He was as curious as I to
get a close view of the queer object with its white cloth
and mast and parcel and chocolate-coloured fragment
half in and half out like a barge’s leeboard, and he bade
the man at the helm put the wheel over by a spoke or
two; but the wind was nearly gone, the barque scarcely
responded to the motion of her rudder, the thread-like
lines at the cut-water had faded, and a roasting, oppressive
calm was upon the water, whitening it out into
a tingling sheen of quicksilver with a fiery shaft of
blinding dazzle, solitary and splendid, working with the
swell like some monstrous serpent of light right under
the sun.</p>

<p>The raft was about six cables’ lengths off us when
the barque came to a dead stand, with a soft, universal
hollowing in of her canvas from royal to course, as
though, like something sentient, she delivered one final
sigh before the swoon of the calm seized her. But now
we were near enough to resolve the floating thing with
the naked eye into details. It was a raft formed of
bamboo canes. A mast about six feet tall was erected
upon it; the dark thing over the edge proved a human
leg, and, when the fabric lifted with the swell and raised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
the leg clear, we saw that the foot had been eaten away
by fish, a number of which were swimming about the
raft, sending little flashes of foam over the pale surface
as they darted along with their back or dorsal fins
exposed. They were all little fish; I saw no sharks.
The body to which the leg belonged was covered by a
white cloth. The captain called my attention to the
parcel attached to the mast, and said that it possibly
contained the food which the Malays leave beside their
dead after burial.</p>

<p>“But let’s go to breakfast now, Mr. Barron,” said
he, with a slow, reproachful, impatient look round the
breathless scene of ocean. “If there’s any amusement
to be got out of that thing yonder there’s a precious
long, quiet day before us, I fear, for the entertainment.”</p>

<p>We breakfasted, and in due course returned on
deck. The slewing of the barque had caused the raft
to shift its bearings, otherwise its distance remained
as it was when we went below.</p>

<p>“Mr. Perkins,” said the captain, “lower a boat
and bring aboard that parcel from the raft’s jury-mast,
and likewise take a peep at the figure under the cloth,
and report its sex and what it looks like.”</p>

<p>I asked leave to go in the boat, and when she was
lowered, with three men in her, I followed Mr. Perkins,
and we rowed over to the raft. All above the frail
bamboo contrivance the water was beautiful with the
colours and movements of innumerable fish. As we
approached we were greeted by an evil smell. The raft<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
seemed to have been afloat for a considerable period;
its submerged portion was green with marine adhesions
or growths. The fellow in the bows of the boat,
manœuvring with the boathook, cleverly snicked the
parcel from the jury-mast and handed it along to the
mate, who put it beside him without opening it, for
that was to be the captain’s privilege.</p>

<p>“Off with that cloth,” said Mr. Perkins, “and then
back water a bit out of this atmosphere.”</p>

<p>The bowman jerked the cloth clear of the raft with
his boathook; the white sheet floated like a snowflake
upon the water for a few breaths, then slowly sank.
The body exposed was stark naked and tawny. It was
a male. I saw nothing revolting in the thing; it would
have been otherwise perhaps had it been white. The
hair was long and black, the nose aquiline, the mouth
puckered into the aspect of a hare-lip; the gleam of a few
white teeth painted a ghastly contemptuous grin upon the
dead face. The only shocking part was the footless leg.</p>

<p>“Shall I hook him overboard, sir?” said the
bowman.</p>

<p>“No, let him take his ease as he lies,” answered
the mate, and with that we returned to the barque.</p>

<p>We climbed over the side, the boat was hoisted
to the davits, and Mr. Perkins took the parcel out of
the stern-sheets and handed it to the captain. The
cover was a kind of fine canvas, very neatly stitched
with white thread. Captain Cayzer ripped through the
stitching with his knife, and exposed a couple of books<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
bound in some kind of skin or parchment. They were
probably the Koran, but the characters none of us
knew. The captain turned them about for a bit, and
I stood by looking at them; he then replaced them
in their canvas cover and put them down upon the
skylight, and by-and-by, on his leaving the deck, he
took them below to his cabin.</p>

<p>The moon rose about ten that night. She came
up hot, distorted, with a sullen face belted with vapour,
but was soon clear of the dewy thickness over the
horizon and showering a pure greenish silver upon
the sea. She made the night lovely and cool: her
reflection sparkled in the dew along the rails, and
her beam whitened out the canvas into the tender
softness of wreaths of cloud motionless upon the
summit of some dark heap of mountain. I looked
for the raft and saw it plainly, and it is not in language
to express how the sight of that frail cradle of death
deepened the universal silence and expanded the prodigious
distances defined by the stars, and accentuated
the tremendous spirit of loneliness that slept like a
presence in that wide region of sea and air.</p>

<p>There had not been a stir of wind all day: not the
faintest breathing of breeze had tarnished the sea
down to the hour of midnight when, feeling weary,
I withdrew to my cabin. I slept well, spite of the
heat and the cockroaches, and rose at seven. I found
the steward in the cabin. His face wore a look of
concern, and on seeing me he instantly exclaimed—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>“The captain seems very ill, sir. Might you know
anything of physic? Neither Mr. Perkins nor me can
make out what’s the matter.”</p>

<p>“I know nothing of physic,” I answered, “but I’ll
look in on him.”</p>

<p>I stepped to his door, knocked, and entered. Captain
Cayzer lay in a bunk under a middling-sized porthole:
the cabin was full of the morning light. I started and
stood at gaze, scarce crediting my sight, so shocked
and astounded was I by the dreadful change which
had happened in the night in the poor man’s appearance.
His face was blue, and I remarked a cadaverous
sinking in of the eyeballs: the lips were livid, the hands
likewise blue, but strangely wrinkled like a washer-woman’s.
On seeing me he asked in a husky whispering
voice for a drink of water. I handed him a full
pannikin, which he drained feverishly, and then began
to moan and cry out, making some weak miserable
efforts to rub first one arm, then the other, then his
legs.</p>

<p>The steward stood in the doorway. I turned to
him, sensible that my face was ashen, and asked some
questions. I then said, “Where is Mr. Perkins?”</p>

<p>He was on deck. I bade the steward attend to
the captain, and passed through the hatch to the
quarter-deck, where I found the mate.</p>

<p>“Do you know that the captain is very ill?”
said I.</p>

<p>“Do I know it, sir? Why, yes. I’ve been sitting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
by him chafing his limbs and giving him water to
drink, and attending to him in other ways. What
is it, d’ye know, sir?”</p>

<p>“<em>Cholera!</em>” said I.</p>

<p>“Oh, my God, I hope not!” he exclaimed. “How
could it be cholera? How could cholera come aboard?”</p>

<p>“A friend of mine died of cholera at Rangoon when
I was there,” said I. “I recognize the looks, and will
swear to the symptoms.”</p>

<p>“But how could it have come aboard?” he exclaimed,
in a voice low but agitated.</p>

<p>My eyes, as he asked the question, were upon the
raft. I started and cried, “Is that thing still there?”</p>

<p>“Ay,” said the mate, “we haven’t budged a foot all
night.”</p>

<p>The suspicion rushed upon me whilst I looked at
the raft, and ran my eyes over the bright hot morning
sky and the burnished surface of sea, sheeting into
dimness in the misty junction of heaven and water.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t be surprised,” said I, “to discover
that we brought the cholera aboard with us yesterday
from that dead man’s raft yonder.”</p>

<p>“How is cholera to be caught in that fashion?”
exclaimed Mr. Perkins, pale and a bit wild in his
way of staring at me.</p>

<p>“We may have brought the poison aboard in the
parcel of books.”</p>

<p>“Is cholera to be caught so?”</p>

<p>“Undoubtedly. The disease may be propagated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
by human intercourse. Why not, then, by books which
have been handled by cholera-poisoned people, or by
the atmosphere of a body dead of the plague?” I
added, pointing at the raft.</p>

<p>“No man amongst us is safe, then, now?” cried
the mate.</p>

<p>“I’m no doctor,” said I; “but I know this, that
contagious poisons, such as scarlet fever and glanders,
may retain their properties in a dormant state for
years. I’ve heard tell of scores of instances of cholera
being propagated through articles of dress. Depend
upon it,” said I, “that we brought the poison aboard
with us yesterday from that accursed death-raft
yonder.”</p>

<p>“Aren’t the books in the captain’s cabin?” said
the mate.</p>

<p>“Are they?”</p>

<p>“He took them below yesterday, sir.”</p>

<p>“The sooner they’re overboard the better,” I exclaimed,
and returned to the cabin.</p>

<p>I went to the captain, and found the steward
rubbing him. The disease appeared to be doing its
work with horrible rapidity; the eyes were deeply
sunk and red; every feature had grown sharp and
pinched as after a long wasting disease; the complexion
was thick and muddy. Those who have
watched beside cholera know that terrific changes may
take place in a few minutes. I cast my eyes about
for the parcel of books, and, spying it, took a stick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
from a corner of the berth, hooked up the parcel,
and, passing it through the open porthole, shook it
overboard.</p>

<p>The captain followed my movements with a languid
rolling of his eyes but spoke not, though he groaned
often, and frequently cried out. I could not in the
least imagine what was proper to be done. His was
the most important life on board the ship, and yet
I could only look on and helplessly watch him expire.</p>

<p>He lived till the evening, and seldom spoke save
to call upon God to release him. I had found an
opportunity to tell him that he was ill of the cholera,
and explained how it happened that the horrible distemper
was on board, for I was absolutely sure we
had brought it with us in that parcel of books; but
his anguish was so keen, his death so close then, that
I cannot be sure he understood me. He died shortly
after seven o’clock, and I have since learnt that that
time is one of the critical hours in cholera.</p>

<p>When the captain was dead I went to the mate,
and advised him to cast the body overboard at once.
He called to some of the hands. They brought the
body out just as the poor fellow had died, and, securing
a weight to the feet, they lifted the corpse over the
rail, and dropped it. No burial service was read. We
were all too panic-stricken for reverence. We got rid
of the body quickly, the men handling the thing as
though they felt the death in it stealing into them
through their fingers—hoping and praying that with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
it the cholera would go. It was almost dark when
this hurried funeral was ended. I stood beside the
mate, looking round the sea for a shadow of wind
in any quarter. The boatswain, who had been one of
the men that handled the body, came up to us.</p>

<p>“Ain’t there nothing to be done with that corpus
out there?” he exclaimed, pointing with a square hand
to the raft. “The men are agreed that there’ll come
no wind whilst that there dead blackie keeps afloat.
And ain’t he enough to make a disease of the hatmosphere
itself, from horizon to horizon?”</p>

<p>I waited for the mate to answer. He said gloomily,
“I’m of the poor captain’s mind. You’ll need to make
something fast to the body to sink it. Who’s to handle
it? I’ll ask no man to do what I wouldn’t do myself,
and rat me if I’d do <em>that</em>!”</p>

<p>“We brought the poison aboard by visiting the raft,
bo’sun,” said I. “Best leave the thing alone. The
corpse is too far off to corrupt the air, as you suppose;
though the imagination’s nigh as bad as the reality,”
said I, spitting.</p>

<p>“If there’s any of them game to sink the thing,
may they do it?” said the boatswain. “For if there’s
ne’er a breeze of wind to come while it’s there——”</p>

<p>“Chaw!” said the mate. “But try ’em, if you
will. They may take the boat when the moon’s up,
should there come no wind first.”</p>

<p>An hour later the steward told me that two of
the sailors were seized with cramps and convulsions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
After this no more was said about taking the boat
and sinking the body. The mate went into the forecastle.
On his return, he begged me to go and look
at the men.</p>

<p>“Better make sure that it’s cholera with them too,
sir,” said he. “You know the signs;” and, folding
his arms, he leaned against the bulwarks in a posture
of profound dejection.</p>

<p>I went forward and descended the forescuttle, and
found myself in a small cave. The heat was overpowering;
there was no air to pass through the little
hatch; the place was dimly lighted by an evil-smelling
lamp hanging under a beam, but, poor as the illumination
was, I could see by it, and when I looked at the
two men and spoke to them, I saw how it was, and
came away sick at heart, and half dead with the hot
foul air of the forecastle, and in deepest distress of
mind, moreover, through perceiving that the two men
had formed a part of the crew of the boat when we
visited the raft.</p>

<p>One died at six o’clock next morning, and the other
at noon; but before this second man was dead three
others had been attacked, and one of them was the
mate. And still never a breath of air stirred the silver
surface of the sea.</p>

<p>The mate was a strong man, and his fear of death
made the conflict dreadful to behold. I was paralyzed
at first by the suddenness of the thing and the
tremendous character of our calamity, and, never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
doubting that I must speedily prove a victim as being
one who had gone in the boat, I cast myself down
upon a sofa in the cabin and there sat, waiting for
the first signal of pain, sometimes praying, or striving
to pray, and seeking hard to accustom my mind to
the fate I regarded as inevitable. But a keen and
biting sense of my cowardice came to my rescue. I
sprang to my feet and went to the mate’s berth, and
nursed him till he died, which was shortly before
midnight of the day of his seizure—so swift and sure
was the poison we had brought from the raft. He
was dropped over the side, and in a few hours later
he was followed by three others. I cannot be sure
of my figures: it was a time of delirium, and I recall
some details of it with difficulty, but I am pretty sure
that by the morning of the fourth day of our falling
in with the accursed raft the ship’s company had
been reduced to the boatswain and five men, making,
with myself, seven survivors of fifteen souls who had
sailed from Calcutta.</p>

<p>It was some time about the middle of the fifth day—two
men were then lying stricken in the forecastle—the
boatswain and a couple of seamen came aft to the
quarter-deck where I was standing. The wheel was
deserted: no man had grasped it since the captain’s
death; indeed, there was nothing to be done at the
helm. The ocean floated in liquid glass; the smell of
frying paint, bubbled into cinders by the roasting rays,
rose like the stench of a second plague to the nostrils.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
The boatswain and his companions had been drinking;
no doubt they had broached the rum casks below. They
had never entered the cabin to my knowledge, nor do
I believe they got their liquor from there. The boatswain
carried a heavy weight of some sort, bound in
canvas, with a long laniard attached to it. He flung
the parcel into the quarter-boat, and roared out—</p>

<p>“If that don’t drag the blistered cuss out of sight
I’ll show the fired carcass the road myself. Cholera
or no cholera, here goes!”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” said I.</p>

<p>“Do?” he cried; “why sink that there plague out
of it, so as to give us the chance of a breeze. Ain’t
this hell’s delight? What’s a-going to blow us clear
whilst <em>he</em> keeps watch?” And he nodded with a fierce
drunken gesture towards the raft.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to handle the body to sink it,” said I.
“You’re well men, now; keep well, won’t you? The
two who are going may be the next taken.”</p>

<p>The three of them roared out drunkenly together,
so muddling their speech with oaths that I did not
understand them. I walked aft, not liking their savage
looks. Shouting and cursing plentifully, they lowered
the boat, got into her by descending the falls, and shoved
off for the raft. They drew alongside the bamboo contrivance,
and I looked to see the boat capsize, so wildly
did they sway her in their wrath and drink as they
fastened the weight to the foot of the body. They then
sank the corpse, and, with the loom of their oars,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
hammered at the raft till the bamboos were scattered
like a sheaf of walking-sticks cut adrift. They now
returned to the barque, clambered aboard, and hoisted
the boat.</p>

<p>The two sick men in the forecastle were at this time
looked after by a seaman named Archer. I have said
it was the fifth day of the calm; of the ship’s company
the boatswain and five men were living, but two were
dying, and that, not counting me, left three as yet well
and able to get about.</p>

<p>This man Archer, when the boatswain and his companions
went forward, came out of the forecastle, and
drank at the scuttle-butt in the waist. He walked
unsteadily, with that effort after stateliness which is
peculiar to tipsy sailors; his eyes wandered, and he
found some difficulty in hitting the bunghole with the
dipper. Yet he was a civil sort of man when sober;
I had occasionally chatted with him during his tricks
at the wheel; and, feeling the need of some one to talk
to about our frightful situation, I walked up to him,
and asked how the sick men did.</p>

<p>“Dying fast,” he answered, steadying himself by
leaning against the scuttle-butt, “and a-ravin’ like
screech-owls.”</p>

<p>“What’s to be done, Archer?”</p>

<p>“Oh, God alone He knows!” answered the man,
and here he put his knuckles into his eyes, and began
to cry and sob.</p>

<p>“Is it possible that this calm can last much longer?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>“It may last six weeks,” he answered, whimpering.
“Down here, when the wind’s drawed away by the sun,
it may take six weeks afore it comes on to blow. Six
weeks of calm down here ain’t thought nothen of,” and
here he burst out blubbering again.</p>

<p>“Where do you get your liquor from?” said I.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t talk of it, don’t talk of it!” he replied,
with a maudlin shake of the head.</p>

<p>“Drinking’ll not help you,” said I; “you’ll all be
the likelier to catch the malady for drinking. This is
a sort of time, I should think, when a man most wants
his senses. A breeze may come, and we ought to decide
where to steer the barque to. The vessel’s under all
plain sail, too, and here we are, four men and a useless
passenger, should it come on to blow suddenly——”</p>

<p>“We didn’t sign on under you,” he interrupted, with
a tipsy scowl, “and as ye ain’t no good either as sailor
or doctor, you can keep your blooming sarmons to yourself
till they’re asked for.”</p>

<p>I had now not only to fear the cholera but to dread
the men. My mental distress was beyond all power of
words to convey: I wonder it did not quickly drive me
crazy and hurry me overboard. I lurked in the cabin
to be out of sight of the fellows, and all the while my
imagination was tormenting me with the first pangs of
the cholera, and every minute I was believing I had the
mortal malady. Sometimes I would creep up the companion
steps and cautiously peer around, and always I
beheld the same dead, faint blue surface of sea stretching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
like an ocean in a dream into the faint indefinable
distances. But shocking as that calm was to me, I
very well knew there was nothing wonderful or preternatural
in it. Our forefoot five days before had struck
the equatorial zone called the Doldrums, and at a
period of the year when a fortnight or even a month of
atmospheric lifelessness might be as confidently looked
for as the rising and setting of the sun.</p>

<p>At nine o’clock that night I was sitting at the cabin
table with biscuit and a little weak brandy and water
before me, when I was hailed by some one at the open
skylight above. It was black night, though the sky
was glorious with stars: the moon did not rise till after
eleven. I had lighted the cabin lamp, and the sheen
of it was upon the face of Archer.</p>

<p>“The two men are dead and gone,” said he, “and
now the bo’sun and Bill are down. There’s Jim dead
drunk in his hammock. I can’t stand the cries of sick
men. What with liquor and pain, the air below suffocates
me. Let me come aft, sir, and keep along with
you. I’m sober now. Oh, Christ, have mercy upon
me! It’s my turn next, ain’t it?”</p>

<p>I passed a glass of brandy to him through the skylight,
then joined him on deck, and told him that the
two dead bodies must be thrown overboard, and the
sick men looked to. For some time he refused to go
forward with me, saying that he was already poisoned
and deadly sick, and a dying man, and that I had no
right to expect that one dying man should wait upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
another. However, I was determined to turn the dead
out of the ship in any case, for in freeing the vessel of
the remains of the victims might lie my salvation. He
consented to help me at last, and we went into the
forecastle, and between us got the bodies out of their
bunks, and dropped them, weighted, over the rail.
The boatswain and the other men lay groaning and
writhing and crying for water; cursing at intervals.
A coil of black smoke went up from the lamp flame to
the blackened beam under which the light was burning.
The atmosphere was horrible. I bade Archer help me
to carry a couple of mattresses on to the forecastle, and
we got the sick men through the hatch, and they lay
there in the coolness with plenty of cold water beside
them and a heaven of stars above, instead of a low-pitched
ceiling of grimy beam and plank dark with
processions of cockroaches, and dim with the smoke
of the stinking slush lamp.</p>

<p>All this occupied us till about half-past ten. When
I went aft I was seized with nausea, and, sinking upon
the skylight, dabbled my brow in the dew betwixt the
lifted lids for the refreshment of the moisture. I
believed that my time had come, and that this sickness
was the cholera. Archer followed me, and seeing
me in a posture of torment, as he supposed, concluded
that I was a dead man. He flung himself upon the
deck with a groan, and lay motionless, crying out at
intervals, “God, have mercy! God, have mercy!”
and that was all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>In about half an hour’s time the sensation of sickness
passed. I went below for some brandy, swallowed
half a glass, and returning with a dram for Archer, but
the man had either swooned or fallen asleep, and I let
him lie. I had my senses perfectly, but felt shockingly
weak in body, and I could think of nothing consolatory
to diminish my exquisite distress of mind. Indeed, the
capacity of realization grew unendurably poignant. I
imagined too well, I figured too clearly. I pictured
myself as lying dead upon the deck of the barque,
found a corpse by some passing vessel after many days;
and so I dreamt, often breaking away from my horrible
imaginations with moans and starts, then pacing the
deck to rid me of the nightmare hag of thought till I
was in a fever, then cooling my head by laying my
cheek upon the dew-covered skylight.</p>

<p>By-and-by the moon rose, and I sat watching it.
In half an hour she was a bright light in the east, and
the shaft of silver that slept under her stretched to the
barque’s side. It was just then that one of the two
sick men on the forecastle sent up a yell. The dreadful
note rang through the vessel, and dropped back to the
deck in an echo from the canvas. A moment after I
saw a figure get on to the forecastle-rail and spring
overboard. I heard the splash of his body, and,
bounding over to Archer, who lay on the deck, I
pulled and hauled at him, roaring out that one of the
sick men had jumped overboard, and then rushed
forward and looked over into the water in the place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
where the man had leapt, but saw nothing, not even a
ripple.</p>

<p>I turned and peered close at the man who lay on
the forecastle, and discovered that the fellow who had
jumped was the boatswain. I went again to the rail
to look, and lifted a coil of rope from a pin, ready to
fling the fakes to the man, should he rise. The moonlight
was streaming along the ocean on this side of
the ship, and now, when I leaned over the rail for the
second time, I saw a figure close under the bows. I
stared a minute or two; the colour of the body blended
with the gloom, yet the moonlight was upon him too,
and then it was that after looking awhile, and observing
the thing to lie motionless, I perceived that it was the
body that had been upon the raft! No doubt the extreme
horror raised in me by the sight of the poisonous
thing beheld in that light and under such conditions
crazed me. I have a recollection of laughing wildly,
and of defying the dark floating shape in insane language.
I remember that I shook my fist and spat at it,
and that I turned to seek for something to hurl at the
body, and it may have been that in the instant of
turning, my senses left me, for after this I can recall
no more.</p>

<p class="tb">The sequel to this tragic and extraordinary experience
will be found in the following statement, made
by the people of the ship <i>Forfarshire</i>, from Calcutta
to Liverpool:—“August 29, 1857. When in latitude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
2° 15´ N. and longitude 79° 40´ E. we sighted a barque
under all plain sail, apparently abandoned. The breeze
was very scanty, and though we immediately shifted
our helm for her on judging that she was in distress,
it took us all the morning to approach her within
hailing distance. Everything looked right with her
aloft, but the wheel was deserted, and there were no
signs of anything living in her. We sent a boat in
charge of the second officer, who returned and informed
us that the barque was the <i>Justitia</i>, of London. We
knew that she was from Calcutta, for we had seen her
lying in the river. The second officer stated that there
were three dead bodies aboard, one in a hammock in
the forecastle, a second on a mattress on the forecastle,
and a third against the coamings of the main-hatch;
there was also a fourth man lying at the heel of the
port cathead—he did not seem to be dead. On this
Dr. Davison was requested to visit the barque, and he
was put aboard by the second officer. He returned
quickly with one of the men, whom he instantly ordered
to be stripped and put into a warm bath, and his clothes
thrown overboard. He said that the dead showed unmistakable
signs of having died from cholera. We
proceeded, not deeming it prudent to have anything
further to do with the ill-fated craft. The person we
had rescued remained insensible for two days; his
recovery was then slow, but sure, thanks to the skilful
treatment of Dr. Davison. He informed us that his
name was Thomas Barron, and that he was a passenger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
on board the <i>Justitia</i> for Capetown. He was the
travelling representative of a large Birmingham firm.
The barque had on the preceding Friday week fallen
in with a raft bearing a dead body. A boat was sent
to bring away a parcel from the raft’s mast, and it is
supposed that the contents of the parcel communicated
the cholera. There were fifteen souls when the vessel
left Calcutta, and all perished except the passenger,
Thomas Barron.”</p>

<h2 id="TRY_FOR_HER_IN_FIFTY">“<i>TRY FOR HER IN FIFTY.</i>”</h2>

<p>The following extraordinary story was told to me some
years ago by the commander of a steamship in which
I was making a voyage for my health. The captain,
who, as we shall see, had himself shared in the experience
he related, began his tale thus:—</p>

<p>“A good many years ago I was in Capetown, having
been forced by illness to quit my post as second mate
of a large ship bound to Bombay. A fortnight after
the ship sailed, I recovered my health and was fit for
work.</p>

<p>“In those days Capetown was without docks; nor
does this carry the memory very far back, either.
Colonial progress is the foremost of the miracles of our
century. You visit some Antipodean shore after a few
years and note a growth of docks, piers, warehouses,
an expansion of suburbs, a magical embracing of the
hillsides by roof upon roof of charming villas, as at
Natal, for example; and whilst you look, you shall
think it rational to hold that more than a century has
gone to the creation of this noble scene of civilization,
and that the little struggling village you remember
arriving at a few years before, with its dockless bay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
and its three or four small ships blistering under the
eye of a roasting sun at their poor moorings alongside
a rustic wooden wharf, was an imagination of your
slumber.</p>

<p>“I was entirely dependent upon my profession.
Sickness had heavily taxed my slender purse, and I
was exceedingly anxious, when I was well enough for
work, to obtain a situation. Ships brought up in the
bay in those days, and discharged for the most part in
lighters. The spacious breast of waters would offer
again and again a grander show than is ever likely to
be seen there in these or succeeding times. There was
no Suez Canal; steam was by no means plentiful. All
the trading to the East was by way of the Cape, and
nearly everything bound round Agulhas looked into
Table Bay for refreshment.</p>

<p>“I remember one of those mornings whilst I was
hunting for a berth, that I counted a hundred and ten
vessels at anchor in Table Bay. To be sure, I have
witnessed as much as five hundred ships straining at
their ground tackle at one time in the Downs. But
that forest of spars had a wide area to distribute itself
over in the waters streaming from the South Foreland
down to the stretch that lies abreast of Sandwich. The
hundred odd craft in Table Bay made a more imposing
sight than the Downs picture, thanks, perhaps, to the
solemn and magnificent scenery of mountain, whose
lofty, silent terraces seemed, in the colossal sweep of
them, to swell and thicken the ships into a stately,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
rocking crowd, and they lay in a tall mass of symmetric
spires, the rigging of one knitting that of another past
her, and the bright wind was painted with the colours
of a dozen nations.</p>

<p>“I stood at the head of a little jetty or pier. Was
there nothing to find me a berth worth six pounds a
month in all that gallant huddle of gleaming sides and
coppered flanks? The water trembled like molten brass
under the sun to the coral-white line of the opposite
shore, where the land went away in strange hues of
rusty red and sickly green, carrying the eye into the
liquid blue distance in which hung a hundred miles off
a range of magnificent mountains like pale gold in the
far light, their sky-lines as clean cut in the full and
even splendour of that magical climate as the top of
Table Mountain, close at hand.</p>

<p>“I was watching a Malay fishing-boat sliding through
the water with an occasional burst of spray off her
weather bow, which arched a little rainbow for her
to rush through, when I was accosted. I turned. It
was the port-captain or harbour-master. I cannot remember
the term by which his office was distinguished.
He had sailed with my father some years earlier, and
I had met him on two occasions in England. He had
done me some kindness whilst I lay ill in lodgings in
Capetown, and had assured me of his willingness to
help me to find a ship when I should be well enough to
go to sea. He was a Scotchman, with a hard, weather-coloured
face, and a dry, arch expression of eye.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘D’ye see anything to fit ye?’ said he.</p>

<p>“‘Ay,’ said I, ‘plenty.’</p>

<p>“‘Well, now,’ said he, ‘you’re the very mon I was
thinking of not half an hour ago. I was in Adderley
Street, and met a captain who was here last year. His
name’s Huddersfield. He’s in charge of a Colonial
trader from a South American port, with a small consignment
for this place, and is bound for Sydney, New
South Wales, where his little ship’s owned, chiefly, I
believe, by himsel’.’</p>

<p>“‘Is there room for me in her?’</p>

<p>“‘Well, yes, I think you’ll stand a chance. She
lost her chief officer overboard when six days’ sail from
this port, and she’s got to ship another man. Take
my advice and go aboard this evening and see the
captain. He’s ashore till five or six o’clock.’</p>

<p>“‘Which is the vessel?’</p>

<p>“He pointed to a large three-masted schooner that
was lying within a hundred strokes of an oar almost
abreast of us. She looked an exceedingly fine craft. A
large Dutch Indiaman was rolling upon the swell of
the sea within a few cables’ length astern of her, and
just ahead rode a Russian auxiliary frigate, very heavily
sparred, with great gleaming windows in her stern, and
a net-work of gilding on either quarter, so that the blue
brine under her counter flashed as to the dart of a
sunbeam whenever she lightly swayed; yet the schooner
held her own in all points as a picture of beauty, and
was not to be dwarfed. The gilded buttons of her trucks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
shone high in the azure of that afternoon; she was
painted white, and a gleam of dark red, like some cold
wet flash of sunset, broke from her metalled bends
whenever she was moved by the inflowing heave of the
water.</p>

<p>“I lingered by the shore for the remainder of the
afternoon, watching the people coming and going from
and to the shipping, until I fancied, indeed I was certain,
that the man I wanted, dressed in white clothes and a
wide-brimmed straw hat, had been put aboard the
schooner by her own boat.</p>

<p>“When I got on board I found the little ship a very
noble, flush-decked vessel, with a clear sweep of sand-bright,
yacht-like plank running from the taffrail to the
‘eyes’; the brass-work was full of the stars of the
western sunshine. The glass of her skylights was dark
and shining. Her ropes were Flemish coiled, as though,
indeed, she had been a man-of-war. Everything was
clean and neat. I guessed she was about three hundred
tons burden. Her crew had knocked off for the day and
were lounging about the windlass, two or three of them
stripped to the waist washing themselves. They had
a colonial air. This might have been owing to their
dress of check shirt, open at the breast, no braces, here
and there moleskins, and here and there a cabbage-tree
hat.</p>

<p>“The second mate, a man whose name I afterwards
ascertained was Curzon, was walking in the gangway
smoking a pipe. I inquired if Captain Huddersfield was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
on board. He asked me what my business was, as
though suspicious of a visit from a stranger after
working hours. I was about to explain the reason
that had brought me to the schooner, when Captain
Huddersfield himself emerged through the little companion
way, and stepped on deck, pausing a moment
with the sharp of his hand to his brow to gaze in the
direction of Capetown.</p>

<p>“He was a tall, gentlemanly-looking person, thickly
bearded, the hair of a rich auburn; the skin of his face
was much burnt by the sun; his eyes were of a liquid
blue, and when he approached and directed them at me
I seemed to find something glowing and tender in them,
as though he were an enthusiast, a man of strange,
perhaps high, but always honest imaginings; a dreamer.
He of all the men that ever I had met at sea the least
corresponded in appearance with the received image of
the nautical man, who, forsooth, whether in fiction or
on the stage, must needs be a fraud from the landgoing
point of view if he be not purple with grog blossoms,
with eyes dim and staring with drink, with legs bent like
the prongs of a pitch fork, and charged to the throat with
a forecastle vocabulary incommunicable even by initials!</p>

<p>“I must say of Captain Huddersfield that never
afloat or ashore had I before beheld in any man a more
placid, benevolent expression of countenance. His age
seemed about forty.</p>

<p>“‘That’s the captain,’ said the second mate.</p>

<p>“I lifted my cap and walked up to him. In a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
words I told my business, adding that I held not only
a chief mate’s, but a master’s certificate of competency.
He eyed me critically but with kindness, and nodded
with something of gravity on my mentioning the name
of the port-captain. After we had exchanged a few
sentences, he took me into the cabin, a bright, breezy
little interior, aromatic with a quantity of plants which
had evidently been recently brought aboard, and cheerful
with mirrors and pictures, as though, in short, this
gentleman was in the habit when he went to sea of
carrying his parlour with him; and bidding me be
seated, he asked a number of questions, all which I saw
with much pleasure, by the expression of his face, I
answered to his satisfaction.</p>

<p>“The interview ended in his offering me the post of
mate of the schooner on a lump wage for the run to
Sydney, and early next morning I went on board with
my chest, and took up my quarters in the cabin.</p>

<p>“I regarded this securing of a post as a fine stroke
of luck, and was mighty thankful. Plentiful as was the
shipping in Table Bay, I had suspected ever since I
went ashore, a sick man, that my chance of getting
a situation aft was small; that, in short, I should be
obliged to get clear of the Cape by offering myself as
a hand. A trip to Sydney was just to my liking, for
amongst the ships there I should find no difficulty in
procuring a berth owing to the gold craze which was
emptying vessels of their crews, from mate to boy,
before they were fairly berthed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>“Four days after I had signed the schooner’s
articles, we weighed and stood out of the Bay. We
were just in time to escape the thrashing of a furious
south-easter which came whipping and howling down
Table Mountain, out of the magnificent milk-white
softness of vapour that half veiled the grand height,
sinking and lifting upon it. A wide surface of water
was whitened by this strange local gale. The limits
of the wind were sharply and extraordinarily defined
by a line of foam, inside of which all was savage popple
and boiling commotion, the ships in it straining wildly,
their loose gear curving, their bunting roaring; whilst
outside all was of a midsummer serenity, the water
rolling like knolls of polished quicksilver, tarnished here
and there by light breathings of wind which delicately
stretched the sails of the Malay boats, and sent them
glancing through it, till the catspaw died out into a
roasting trance of burnished brine.</p>

<p>“We were, as I have said, a three-masted schooner,
square-rigged forward, with an immense hoist of lower-mast
for a square foresail, and a length of flying jibboom
that made us all wings from the golden gleam of the
figure-head to the tack of the flying jib. I had never
before been shipmate with fore and aft canvas. All my
knowledge of the sea had been picked up under square
yards. There was nothing I could not do with a full-rigged
ship, nor need a square-rigger and an old hand
be charged with egotism for saying so. But when it
came to boom-mainsails and gaff-foresails, and ropes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
and rigging with unfamiliar names, I could only idly
look on for awhile. But I did not doubt I should be
able to quickly learn everything necessary to be known,
and, meantime, when we were well out at sea, with the
high African land upon our port quarter, blue in the air,
with distant mountains trembling towards their summits
into silver, and the mighty Southern Ocean stretching
over our bows away down to the white silence of the
Antarctic parallels, I watched the behaviour of the
schooner with interest.</p>

<p>“The breeze was abeam, the whole hot distance of
the rich blue ocean was in it, there was no land for
hundreds of leagues to break or hinder it; the schooner
leaned over and flashed her sheathing at the northern
sun, and stretched along the deep with the look of a
flying hare. The white water poured aft from her
shearing stem, her riband of wake sparkled to midway
the horizon in a soaring and sinking vein of silver full
of frost-like lights and wreaths of foam bells. It was
like yachting, and I reckoned upon a quick run to Sydney.</p>

<p>“From the hour of my coming aboard officially,
Captain Huddersfield exhibited a very friendly, almost
cordial disposition. He was a man of good education,
a sailor first of all, but a gentleman also, not highly
varnished perhaps, wanting in the airs and graces of
the drawing-room, but abundantly possessed of those
qualities which, when glazed and brightened by shore-going
observance and habit, cause men to be esteemed
for their breeding and bearing. He had a regard for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
me, I think, because, like himself, I was not wholly a
copy of the dramatic and romantic notions of the sailor.
I neither swore nor drank. I was ever of opinion that
it did not follow, because a man got his living under the
commercial flag of his country, he must needs cultivate
all qualities of blackguardism as a condition of his
calling. I could not for the life of me understand why
an officer in the merchant service should not be able to
behave himself on board ship and ashore with as lively
a sense of his duty and obligations as a gentleman as if
he wore the buttons of the State.</p>

<p>“Possibly my friend, the port-captain at Capetown,
had prejudiced Huddersfield in my favour. Then again,
though he lived in Sydney, he was an Englishman
born; his native county was mine, and this little
circumstance alone, all those watery leagues away from
the old home, was enough to establish a bond between
us. Nevertheless, I did not observe that he was very
communicative about his own affairs. For the first few
days until the furious weather set in, we often conversed,
but I never found that our chats left me with any
knowledge of his past or of his business; as, for instance,
how long he had lived in New South Wales, the occasion
that had despatched him there, what his commercial
interests were outside his schooner, whether he was
married, and so forth.</p>

<p>“It breezed up ahead after we had been at sea a few
days. The <i>Cambrian</i> looked well to windward, but she
was still points off her course. Then again the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
Agulhas Stream set us to leeward, and our progress was
slow. On the 22nd day of the month, we then being
four days out from Table Bay, the weather blackened
on a sudden in an afternoon in the north, the lightning
streamed like cataracts of violet flame on those sooty
sierras of storm, the thunder rolled continuously, but it
was not till the edge of the electric stuff, black as midnight,
was over our mastheads, with sea and sky dim
and frightful as though beheld in the deep shadow of a
total eclipse of the sun, that the hurricane took us.</p>

<p>“It came along in a note of thunder, sharp-edged
with the continuous shrieking of wind; the sea boiled
under it and raced with the diabolic outfly in a high
white wall of water. It swept upon us with a flash in a
whole sky-full of salt smoke, and the air was like a snow-storm
with the throb and flight of the yeast; the trifle of
canvas that had been left exposed vanished as a puff of
steam would. The schooner lay over till her starboard
shear poles were under, and then it was deep enough to
drown a man in the lee scuppers.</p>

<p>“It was doubtful for some time whether she would
right, and I was clawing my way forward with some
dim hope of getting at the carpenter’s chest for an axe
for the weather laniards, when the noble little craft
suddenly rose buoyant, with the long savage yell of the
gale in her rigging as she thrashed her lofty spars to
windward.</p>

<p>“After this she made fairly good weather of it,
but for three days we lay under bare poles, sagging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
helplessly to leeward in the trough of that mighty ocean.
The weather then moderated; within six hours of the
breaking of the gale it was blowing a gentle wind out of
the north-east; the sun shone brightly and the schooner
flapped leisurely along her course under all plain sail
and over a large but fast subsiding swell.</p>

<p>“During the time of violent weather Captain Huddersfield
had seemed much depressed in spirits. I had
attributed his dejection to the peril of those hours. We
were a small ship for that tall southern surge. Moreover
his risk in the vessel might be large for all I knew.
I could not guess how gravely I misjudged one of the
manliest intelligences that ever informed a sailor.</p>

<p>“We were seated alone at dinner on the first day of
fine weather. He said, after regarding me steadfastly
for some moments—</p>

<p>“‘Do you attach any meaning to dreams?’</p>

<p>“‘I do not,’ I answered.</p>

<p>“‘But when they recur?’ said he.</p>

<p>“‘No,’ said I, ‘not though they should recur for a
month of Sundays.’</p>

<p>“‘Do you know of any superstitions in connection
with dreams?’ he asked.</p>

<p>“‘I remember,’ said I, ‘an old woman once told me
that to dream of a smooth sea is a sign of a prosperous
voyage, but of a rough sea a stormy and unprofitable
one.’</p>

<p>“He shook his head with a little impatience, without
smiling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘Then, again,’ said I, taxing my memory to oblige
him, for this sort of talk was sad stuff to my way of
thinking, ‘a sailor once told me that if you dream of a
dolphin you’re bound to lose your sweetheart. And the
same man said that to dream of drowning was a promise
of good luck. The hopefullest of all sea-dreams, I
believe, is the vision of an anchor. ’Tis a fact,’ said I,
finding myself thoughtful for a moment, ‘that I dreamt
of an anchor the night before I received a letter from an
uncle containing a cheque for two hundred pounds—the
only money I ever received from a relative in all my
life.’</p>

<p>“He was silent for a while, and then said, speaking
in a very serious voice—</p>

<p>“‘For three nights running the same odd vision has
troubled me. I have thrice dreamt that I was becalmed
in an icy atmosphere of Antarctic darkness. The stars
rode brilliantly, but they made no light. Regularly
through this black atmosphere there sounded, in a note
of sighing, human with articulation, and yet resembling
the noise made by the whale when it spouts its fountain,
these mysterious words: “<em>Try for her in fifty!</em>” “<em>Try
for her in fifty!</em>” Over and over again it so ran: “<em>Try
for her in fifty!</em>” Now, to have dreamt this <em>once</em> would
be nothing; <em>twice</em> makes it remarkable; the <em>third</em> time
of the same vision must affect even the most wooden of
minds with a spirit as of conviction. I don’t believe in
dreams any more than you do, yet there ought to be
some sort of meaning in the repetition of one, in such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
haunting cry repeated on several occasions of slumber
as, “<em>Try for her in fifty!</em>”’</p>

<p>“‘Well, sir, it’s strange,’ I exclaimed, ‘and that’s
about the amount of it. I’ve somewhere heard of men
rescued in a starving state from a desolate island
through a dream. The captain’s nephew was the
dreamer, I think. The same vision troubled him three
times, as yours did. He was a young Frenchman, and
the dream made him importunate. The skipper shifted
his helm to oblige the lad, and on sighting the island or
rock found a little company of gaunt Selkirks upon it.’</p>

<p>“Thus we reasoned the matter awhile; he conversed
as though he was worried at heart; when I went
on deck, however, I flattered myself I had left him with
an easier mind.</p>

<p>“He did not afterwards in that day refer to the
subject, nor next morning when he came out of his
cabin soon after sunrise, did he tell me that he had
again been troubled in his sleep by that mysterious
haunting cry, sounding across the black cold ocean of
his dreams like the noise made by a whale, when it
spouts its fountain to the stars in some midnight hush.</p>

<p>“A few days after we had had that talk I have just
repeated, almost immediately on making eight bells by
our sextant, a man on the forecastle hailing the quarter-deck
bawled out that there was a small black object on
the lee bow. Captain Huddersfield levelled the telescope,
and said the thing was a ship’s quarter-boat with
a man standing up in her. The weather was quiet at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
this time, the breeze a light one. The schooner was
rippling leisurely forward with an occasional flap of her
canvas that flashed a light as of the sun itself into the
blue air all about the masts. The junction of sea and
sky was in haze, with here and there a dim blue shadow
of cloud poised coast-like upon the horizon.</p>

<p>“I took the glass from the captain and made out a
boat with a mast but no sail. The figure of a man stood
erect, and one arm hooked the mast. We shifted our
helm, and presently had the boat alongside.</p>

<p>“Two men were in her. One lay motionless under
the thwarts. The other, though erect on his feet, had
barely strength to catch the rope’s end that was flung.
The boat was of the ordinary pattern of ship’s quarter-boat.
Whilst we leaned over the side looking down into
her, the captain said—</p>

<p>“‘What is the name written in the stern-sheets
there?’</p>

<p>“My sight was good. I answered, ‘<i>Prairie Chief</i>.’</p>

<p>“He started, and turned pale, with a look of astonishment
and horror, but said nothing.</p>

<p>“Meanwhile, the two men were being got aboard.
One was lifeless, and his looks seemed to tell of his
having been frozen rather than starved to death. They
were both dressed in the plain garb of the merchant
sailor. The one that lived was assisted forward and
disappeared in the forecastle in the company of two or
three sympathizing seamen of our crew. Nothing so
appeals to the humanity of the British sailor as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
misery that is expressed by the open boat. In this case
no appeal could have been more complete. I jumped
into the little craft in obedience to the captain’s orders
and overhauled her, and found nothing to eat or drink.
Her cargo was an empty beaker and some fragments of
canvas which appeared to have been chewed. The very
heart within me sickened at the story of anguish that
was silently related by those dusky, dough-like lumps of
canvas. We hoisted the boat aboard. The weather
permitted us to do that, and she was too good and useful
a boat to lose.</p>

<p>“In the afternoon we buried the body of the dead,
nameless seaman; nameless, because it seemed that the
other was incapable of relating his story; pain and
famine had paralyzed the tongue in his mouth. The
captain read the service; his manner was so subdued,
his whole demeanour expressed him as so affected,
that you would have supposed he was burying some
dear friend or near relative. I had often attended
a burial service at sea, but never one more impressive
than this. All the desolation of the mighty deep seemed
to have centred, as in a very spirit, in the lifeless body
that lay stitched in a hammock in the gangway.</p>

<p>“When the body was overboard the captain walked
to the boat we had hoisted in, and stood with his first
look of amazement and grief, musing upon, or rather
staring at the name <i>Prairie Chief</i> painted in the stern-sheets.
He then went to his cabin. When he again
made his appearance some time afterwards he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
extraordinarily reserved and gloomy. Throughout the
watches he would ask if the man was better. I do not
recollect that he addressed another word to me than
that question.</p>

<p>“Next forenoon, some time about eight bells, the
man was sufficiently recovered to come aft. I stood
beside Captain Huddersfield, sextant in hand, whilst he
talked to him. He said his name was James Dickens,
and that he had been an able seaman aboard the barque
<i>Prairie Chief</i>. The ship was from London bound to
Sydney. South of the Cape they met with very heavy
weather from the northward, which hove them to and
drove them south; it was so thick the captain could not
get an observation. The wind slackened and the captain
made sail, defying the thickness; he was impatient and
had already made a long passage, and was resolved,
happen what might, to ‘ratch’ north for a clear sky.
In the middle of the day, when the smother upon the
sea was so thick that the flying-jibboom end was out
of sight from the wheel, a loud and fearful cry of ‘Ice
right ahead!’ rang from the forecastle. The wheel was
revolved, every spoke, with the fury of despair, by the
helmsman; but the ship’s time was come, and there was
nothing in seamanship to manœuvre her clear of her
fate. She telescoped into the ice and went to pieces.</p>

<p>“This, Dickens said, had happened about ten days
before we fell in with the boat. The disaster was not
so frightfully sudden but that there was time for some
to escape. A number of people, said the man, got upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
the ice. Amongst them were the captain, his wife, and
a female passenger. Dickens particularly noticed these
people, that is, the commander and the two women.
He and three others drifted away in a boat. The barque
went to pieces aloft when she struck; he was sure that
none others saving himself and the three men escaped
in the boats. It was in the middle of the day when the
ship ran into the berg, and the darkness happened so
quickly after the disaster that he was unable to tell
much of what followed. Two of his companions died
whilst they were adrift and their bodies were dropped
overboard.</p>

<p>“Whilst Dickens told his story I watched the captain.
His features were knitted into an expression of consternation,
yet he never once interrupted the man.
When the sailor had made an end of his story, Huddersfield
said, in a slow level voice—</p>

<p>“‘Was your commander Captain Smalley?’</p>

<p>“‘Yes, sir.’</p>

<p>“‘Was one of the female passengers Mrs. Huddersfield?’</p>

<p>“‘It was her name, sir.’</p>

<p>“The captain turned his eyes upon me and cried,
with a sudden wild toss of his hands that somehow gave
an extraordinary pathos to his words and looks, ‘She is
my wife!’</p>

<p>“Nothing was said for some moments. I was at
a loss for speech. It was the same as hearing of the
death of one beloved by the person you are with when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
the news is given to him; what can you say? Presently
I said to the man—</p>

<p>“‘Did you sight any ships whilst you were adrift?’</p>

<p>“‘Nothing, sir.’</p>

<p>“‘But won’t the ice you ran into,’ said I, ‘be well
within the limits of the ocean fairway?’</p>

<p>“He could not answer me this.</p>

<p>“‘How far south did you drift?’</p>

<p>“He did not know.</p>

<p>“‘If they are on the ice is it too late to rescue them,
sir?’ I inquired, addressing the captain, after another
pause.</p>

<p>“He seemed too distracted by grief to heed my
question.</p>

<p>“‘I had hoped,’ he said, speaking in short breathings
and broken sentences, ‘to find her safe at Sydney on
my arrival there; she went home last year on a visit to
her mother. It was arranged that Captain Smalley,
an old friend, should bring her out. Ten days ago,’
he muttered to himself, ‘ten days ago.’ He covered
his eyes with his hand, then looking vacantly at his
sextant, went to the rail and seemed to stare out to sea
into the south.</p>

<p>“I was about to question Dickens afresh when the
captain rounded upon us in a very flash of white face
and wild, eager manner.</p>

<p>“‘Try for her in fifty!’ he cried, looking at me, but
as though he saw some one beyond me.</p>

<p>“I viewed him with silent surprise. The very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
memory and therefore the meaning of the words he now
pronounced had gone out of my head, and I did not
understand him.</p>

<p>“‘Try for her in fifty!’ he repeated. ‘I know what
it means.’</p>

<p>“He went in a sort of a run to the wheel, and
brought the schooner’s head to a due southerly course,
whilst he shouted in tones vibrating with the excitement
that seemed like mania in the man then, with the workings
of his face—I say he shouted for sail to be trimmed
for the course he had brought the schooner to, and the
seamen fled about the decks to my commands, alert and
willing, but as astonished as I was. When sail had
been trimmed the captain called to Mr. Curzon to keep
her steady as she went, and requested me to follow him
below.</p>

<p>“He stood beside the table and leaned upon it; his
agitation was so extreme that I thought to see his
mother in his eyes. His breathing continued distressingly
laboured for some time; indeed, the emotions
and passions which tore him appeared to have arrested
the faculty of speech. At last he exclaimed in a voice
low with religious awe, yet threaded too with a note of
triumph that instantly caught my ear—</p>

<p>“‘Do you now guess the meaning of that dream
which was three times dreamt by me?’</p>

<p>“Still I was at a loss and made no answer.</p>

<p>“‘Try for her in fifty!’ he exclaimed. ‘That was
the cry I told you about. You remember the sentence,
surely?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘Yes, clearly now, sir, that you recall it.’</p>

<p>“‘Come, let’s work out the latitude,’ he said, ‘and
we’ll find that iceberg’s situation. My heart’s on fire.
Oh!’ he cried, but softly, in a tone that thrilled through
me, ‘my wife is dear to me. I pray, I pray! we may
not be too late.’</p>

<p>“I still failed to grasp what was in his mind, and
suspected that his reason had been a little weakened by
the shock of the news he had received. When we had
worked out our observations he exposed the chart he
used to prick off the ship’s course on, and mused upon
it, and measured angles and distances.</p>

<p>“‘It is at this season,’ said he, ‘that the ice breaks
away out of the south and comes in fleets of bergs
thickly crowding north. There’s been heavy weather.
We’ll not allow for a larger drift than a league a day.
Try for her in fifty. That’s it. That will put the
berg when the <i>Prairie Chief</i> struck it in about fifty-one.’</p>

<p>“I thought now I began to understand him.</p>

<p>“‘You mean fifty-one degrees of south latitude?’</p>

<p>“‘Of course I do,’ he answered.</p>

<p>“I measured the distance due south from the place
where our ship then was, and made it a few hundred
miles—I forget the figure.</p>

<p>“‘It’s a short run,’ said he, looking at the chart.
‘The boat did it in ten days, and that’s not above three
knots an hour.’ I was silent. ‘I shall strike the
parallel of fifty degrees,’ he continued, after a pause,
‘then run away east. If I sight nothing I shall head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
back. I’ll find her—under God,’ he added, removing
his cap, and glancing upwards with an expression of
rapt devotion.</p>

<p>“This was an extraordinary undertaking, prompted
as it was by an impulse bred of the imagination of a
mind in slumber, yet by no means irrational, seeing
that it was certain, if the seaman Dickens reported
aright, there was a shipwrecked company upon an iceberg
within a few days’ sail.</p>

<p>“The crew were briefly told that Captain Huddersfield’s
wife had been aboard the <i>Prairie Chief</i>, and that
the schooner was going to seek the survivors of the
wreck. It will be supposed, however, that no hint was
dropped as to the mysterious voice which had spoken in
the whisper of a giant in the captain’s dream. Curzon,
the second mate, said that apart from the heavy odds
against our falling in with the particular iceberg we
wanted, there was the certainty, should we strangely
enough encounter the mass of ice, of our finding the
people dead of cold and starvation. I answered there
was no certainty about it, and quoted several instances
of astonishing deliverances from floating bodies of ice
as recorded in the old marine chronicles.</p>

<p>“Not until the fourth day did we strike the latitude
of 50°, in which time we saw no ice. The ocean was
of a marvellous rich blue, the heavens a deep and
thrilling violet, with coasts of swelling white vapour of
a rusty bronze in their brows lying upon the glass-like
line of the horizon. We now headed due east; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
sailors thought our quest was ended! Throughout the
glittering frosty hours—the wind blew with a piercing
breath down here—Captain Huddersfield kept a look-out.
He was for ever crossing the deck to peer ahead,
and again and again, slinging a binocular glass over his
shoulder, he would go aloft on to the little fore-royal-yard,
where he stayed till the bitter cold drove him
down.</p>

<p>“At midnight on this day we sighted a large ice-island,
pale as alabaster under the moon, and shortened
canvas to approach it. We hove-to till the grey of the
dawn, when the rising sun gave us a magnificent picture
of a floating mountain bristling with pinnacles, a
principality of turrets and castellated eminences, majestic
in solitude. The man Dickens said it was not the berg.
We sailed round it, keeping a sharp look-out for the
loose ice, and then observing no signs of life, save a
number of birds, proceeded.</p>

<p>“This same day we fell in with five different bergs,
of various sizes, all of which we approached, and
carefully examined; but to no purpose. Then for some
long hours we encountered no more ice; but all this
while we sailed steadily on the parallel of 50° S., making
a due east course.</p>

<p>“And now comes the amazing part of this tale. I
went on deck at midnight to take charge of the schooner.
On walking to the side as my custom was, and gazing
steadily ahead—a corner of the moon at this time
hung in the sky over the port-quarter—I beheld a dim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
faintness right ahead, a delicate gleam like some
mysterious reflection of light in a looking-glass in a
darkened room. A man came along from the forecastle,
and sung out in a quiet voice that there was ice ahead.
I bade him rout out Dickens; it was his watch below,
but whenever ice was reported we had him up, and
stationed him on the forecastle to keep a look-out as
the one and only man in the vessel who would know
the berg we were in search of. I then ran to
the companion hatch and called to the captain, who
was lying upon a locker below, and he immediately
arrived.</p>

<p>“The wind was scanty, and our speed through the
water scarcely four knots, but hardly had day broken—the
ice-island being then about a mile distant—when
Dickens, who had remained on the forecastle throughout
the dark hours, shrieked out—</p>

<p>“‘The iceberg, sir!’</p>

<p>“It was a fine morning, the sea quiet, the wind a
nipping air out of the south-west; the sun shone full
upon the iceberg, and flashed it into a great moon-white
floating heap, scored with ravines and gorges. The
swell rushed in thunder into deep caverns. I saw many
Gothic archways with birds flying in them; the mass
was like a city of alabaster, the home of sea spirits, of
ocean fowl of mighty pinion; the surf boiled in thunder
on the windward points. I observed a shelf of the
dead-white crystal sloping very gently like a beach into
the wash of the water, and whilst I was gazing at it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
the captain, who was working away at the berg with
a telescope, cried out fiercely; then growing inarticulate,
he put the glass into my hand, gaping at the ice, and
pointing to it.</p>

<p>“I levelled the glass, and immediately distinguished
a structure, contrived, as I presently saw, of the galley
of a ship, and a quantity of wreckage. It stood in a
great split in the ice, within musket-shot of the beach,
and whilst I looked smoke rose from it.</p>

<p>“‘There is life there!’ I cried out.</p>

<p>“We hauled in, and then with the naked eye clearly
perceived several figures making signs to us. When we
were as close as prudence permitted, the long-boat was
got over, and the captain and five men, one of them
being Dickens, pulled away towards the berg. I stood
off to improve my offing, and being full of the business
of the schooner, had little opportunity to remark what
passed on the ice-island.</p>

<p>“By-and-by the boat returned; she looked to be
full of people. When she was alongside I saw two
women in her. One was locked in the embrace of
Captain Huddersfield; he had wrapped her in his
coat, and held her to his heart. Both women were
lifted over the side; three of the men were also
handed up. The others managed to crawl on deck
unaided. There were seven men and two women.
They afterwards told us that fifteen in all had gained
the ice.</p>

<p>“The wife of the captain of the <i>Prairie Chief</i>—he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
was amongst those who had perished—died before our
arrival in Sydney. Mrs. Huddersfield, a stronger
woman, quickly recovered, and was walking the deck in
the sun, leaning on her husband’s arm, within a week
of her rescue.”</p>

<h2 id="THE_CHILIMAN_TRAGEDY"><i>THE “CHILIMAN” TRAGEDY.</i></h2>

<p>In the year 1863 I sailed as ship’s doctor aboard the
<i>Chiliman</i>, in the third voyage that fine Blackwall liner
made to Melbourne. I had obtained the berth through
the influence of a relative. My own practice was a
snug little concern in a town some fifty miles from
London; but a change was needed, a change for my
health, such a change as nothing but the oceans of the
world with their several climates and hundred winds
could provide, and so I resolved to go a voyage round
the world on the easy terms of feeling pulses and
administering draughts, with nothing to pay and nothing
to receive, a seat at the cabin table, and a berth fitted
with shelves and charged with a very powerful smell of
chemist’s shop down aft in what is called the steerage.</p>

<p>I joined the ship at the East India Docks, and went
below to inspect my quarters. I found them gloomy
and small; but any rat-hole was reckoned good enough
in those days for a ship’s doctor, a person who, though
of the first importance to the well-being of a ship, is, as
a rule, treated by most owners and skippers with the
same sort of consideration that in former times a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
parson to a nobleman received, until he had obliged my
lord by marrying his cast lady.</p>

<p>First let me briefly sketch this interior of saloon and
steerage, since it is the theatre on which was enacted
the extraordinary tragedy I am about to relate. The
<i>Chiliman</i> had a long poop; under this was the saloon,
in those days termed the cuddy; cabins very richly
bulkheaded went away down aft on either hand. Amidships
was the table, overhead the skylights, and the
deck was pierced by the shaft of the mizzen-mast,
superbly decorated with a pianoforte secured to the
deck just abaft it. There were no ladies’ saloons,
smoking-rooms, bath-rooms, as in this age, though the
ship was one of the handsomest of her class. If you
sought retirement you went to your cabin; if you
desired a pipe you stepped on deck; if you asked for
a bath you were directed to the head pump.</p>

<p>The <i>Chiliman’s</i> cuddy was entered from the quarter-deck
by doors close beside the two flights of steps which
conducted to the poop. A large square of hatch yawned
near the entrance inside, and you descended a staircase
to the steerage where my berth was. The arrangement
of this steerage resembled that of the cuddy, but
the bulkheads and general furniture were in the last
degree plain. I believe they charged about twenty-five
pounds for a berth down here, and sixty or seventy
guineas for a cabin up above.</p>

<p>Whilst I stood in my berth looking around me a
little bow-legged man, in a camlet jacket and a large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
strawberry mark on his cheek, peered in and asked if I
was the doctor.</p>

<p>“Ay, Dr. Harris,” said I.</p>

<p>“I’m the ship’s steward, sir,” said he. “That’s
where I sleep,” and he pointed to a cabin opposite.</p>

<p>I was glad to make this man’s acquaintance, and
was very civil to him. I would advise all sea-going
doctors on long-voyage sailing ships to speedily make
friends with the head steward. I remarked upon the
gloominess of my quarters, and said I was afraid when
it came to my making up draughts I might blunder for
the want of light. He answered that the sailors never
expected much more than strong doses of glauber salts,
and that in his experience passengers as a rule managed
very well without physic until they got ashore again.</p>

<p>I asked him if we were a full ship. He answered,
pretty full. About half the steerage berths were
taken, and the same number of cabins would be
occupied in the saloon. The ’tween-decks were crowded,
he told me.</p>

<p>After this chat I went on deck, where I made the
acquaintance of the captain and the chief mate. The
ship was still in the docks, and the captain had just come
aboard, and was talking to the first officer when I walked
up to them. The decks were full of life, and the scene
was charged with excitement and interest. Groups of
’tween-decks people stood about, and numbers of drunken
sailors were bawling and cutting capers on the forecastle;
some saloon passengers who had joined the ship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
in the docks walked the poop; Blue Peter was streaming
at our fore-royal-masthead under the grey sky of
the Isle of Dogs; in all directions rose the masts of
ships, a complicated forest, bewildering with the lace-work
and tracery of rigging. Cargo was swinging in
and out; pawls of capstan and winch were ticking like
gigantic clocks to the thrust of the handspike and the
revolution of the handle; the air was full of the smell
of distant climes; I seemed to taste coffee and nutmeg
and a pungent tickling of black pepper; but the
perfume of the greasy wool-bale was dominant, and
suggested nothing of the sweetness of the Arabian gale.</p>

<p>The captain went below, the mate fell a-shouting,
I walked to the brass rail that ran across the break of
the poop, and gazed about me. The steerage passengers
on the main-deck looked a shabbily-dressed lot of poor,
distressed people—men, women, and children. I took
notice that certain young fellows, apprentices or midshipmen,
with brass buttons on their jackets and brass
badges on their caps, warned them off the quarter-deck
whenever they stepped abaft the mainmast. One of
these young fellows came and stood beside me. He
was a gentlemanly, fair-haired, handsome lad, now
making, as he presently told me, his second voyage.
I asked him why those poor people were ordered off
the part of the deck that lay immediately beneath us.
He said because it was the quarter-deck, to be used
only by the second-class passengers.</p>

<p>“That dirty rabble,” said he, looking with disgust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
at the third-class folks, “must keep to the waist and
forecastle if they want air.”</p>

<p>“And this fine deck of poop?” said I.</p>

<p>“Nobody uses this,” he answered, “but the saloon
nobs, and the officers and the midshipmen of the ship.”</p>

<p>Shortly before eleven the vessel hauled out of dock.
There was much noise of yelling and swearing at this
time; my sight and hearing were confounded, and I
wondered that any mortal being should understand
the exact thing to do in such a scene of clamorous
distraction. People on the pier-heads shrieked farewells
to those on board, and those on board sobbed
and yelped in response. When we had floated over
the cill, with the mud pilot on the forecastle almost
apoplectic with unavailing wrath at some insult fired
at him out of a hurricane lung on the wharf, a tug got
hold of us, a couple of seamen lurched aft to the wheel,
the hawser tautened, and away we went down the river
in the fizzing wake of a pair of churning paddles.</p>

<p>The varied scenery of the Thames—I mean its
maritime details of craft of twenty different rigs and
steamers of twenty different aspects thrusting up and
down, some staggering athwart, others making a bee-line
through the reaches—charmed and interested me
who was fresh from a long spell of inland, almost
rural, life, and I lingered till I was driven below by
the wet which came sweeping along in a succession of
drenching squalls as we rounded out of Galleon’s into
Barking Reach. I spent the remainder of that day in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
putting my cabin to rights, examining the drugs (some
of which, for antiquity, methought, might have gone
round the world with Cook in his first voyage), and in
providing for my own comfort as best I could, and at
half-past six went into the cuddy to join the people
at dinner, by which hour the ship had arrived at a
mooring-buoy off Gravesend, and was lying motionless
on her own shadow in the stream.</p>

<p>It was a sullen evening, already dark; and dirty
blowing wet weather on deck. The muffled howling
and hissing of the wind in the three towering spires
of mast, and yard, and rigging communicated, I’ve no
doubt, the particular brilliance and beauty I found in
the appearance of the well-lighted cuddy, with its long
table draped for dinner, sparkling with glass and plate,
and a number of ladies and gentlemen, along with the
captain and chief officer, issuing from their respective
berths to take their seats. Thirteen of us sat down,
and when this was remarked by an elderly lady next
the captain, a midshipman was sent for to neutralize
the sinister influence of that number by making a
fourteenth. The lad took his place with a countenance
of happy astonishment. He heartily wished, I dare say,
that thirteen people would sit down to dinner every day.</p>

<p>I understood that there were some eight or ten more
passengers expected from Gravesend in the morning.
I looked about me to see what sort of persons I was
to be associated with on an ocean passage that might
run into four months. No need in this brief record of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
a tragic event to enter into minute descriptions of the
people: enough if I refer now to two persons who sat
opposite me, both of whom were to prove leading actors
in what I have to tell.</p>

<p>One of them was a man of about six-and-thirty years
of age. He wore a heavy moustache slightly streaked
with grey. His eyes were dark, keen, and steadfast
in their gaze—steadfast, indeed, to rudeness, for his
manner of looking at you was scarcely less than a
deliberate scrutinizing stare. His hair was thin on
the top, bushy at the sides; his complexion dark as
of one who has lived long under the sun. His voice
was subdued, his whole bearing well bred.</p>

<p>His companion was a lady: a dark, very handsome
woman of three or four and twenty. Her hair was
black, without gloss, a soft, dark, rich black, and I
never before saw a woman with so wonderful a thickness
of hair as that girl had. Her large, fine, dark
eyes had a tropic sparkle; there was foreign blood in
the glances which flashed through the long lashes.
Her complexion was a most delicate olive made tender
by a soft lasting bloom, which rested like a lingering
blush upon her cheeks. Her figure looked faultless,
and doubtless was so. I put the man down as a
happy fellow carrying a beautiful bride away with him
to the Antipodes. You could not have doubted that
they were newly married; his behaviour was all fondness;
hers that of the impassioned young wife who
finds difficulty in concealing her adoration in public.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>I have thus sketched them, but I own that I was
not more particularly interested in the couple than in
others of the people who sat on either hand. The chief
mate of the ship, however, Mr. Small, who occupied a
seat on my left, concluded that my interest was sufficiently
keen to justify him in talking to me about them;
and in a low voice he told me that they were Captain
and Mrs. Norton-Savage; he didn’t quite know what
he was captain of, but he had gathered from some
source he couldn’t recollect that he had made a fortune
in South America, in Lima or Callao, and had been
married a few weeks only, and was going to live in
Australia, as his wife’s health was not good, and the
doctors believed the Australian climate would suit her.</p>

<p>Early next morning the rest of the passengers came
on board, the tug again took us in tow, and under a
dark blue sky, mountainous with masses of white
cloud, the <i>Chiliman</i> floated in tow of the tug into
Channel waters, where a long flowing heave despatched
a great number of us to our cabins.</p>

<p>We met with nothing but head winds and chopping
seas down Channel. The ship lurched and sprang
consumedly, and the straining noises of bulkheads
and strong fastenings were so swift and furious in
that part of the vessel where I slept that I’d sometimes
think the fabric was going to pieces at my end of her.
I was very sea-sick, but happily my services were never
required in that time.</p>

<p>I think we were five days in beating clear of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
Channel; the weather then changed, the sky brightened
into a clear azure, delicately shaded by clouds; a soft
wind blew out of the west, and when I made my first
appearance on deck I found the ship clothed in swelling
canvas from truck to waterway; her sand-white decks
were lively with people in motion and the swaying
shadows of the rigging; a number of ladies and gentlemen
walked the poop, and the captain, with a telescope
at his eye, was looking at a small steamer that was
passing us at about a mile with a colour flying; Captain
and Mrs. Norton-Savage stood beside him, also looking
at the steamer; the foam spun along the ship’s side in
wool-white wreaths, and every bubble shone like a bit
of rainbow, and the streak of the vessel’s wake gleamed
upon the flowing lines of the ocean astern as though
she trailed a length of mother-o’-pearl.</p>

<p>All sights and sounds were beautiful and refreshing.
I breathed deep, with exquisite enjoyment of the ocean
air after my spell of confinement in my apothecary-shop
of a cabin, and with growing admiration of the
spectacle of the noble ship, slightly heeling from the
breeze, and curtsying stately as she went, till you’d
think she kept time to some solemn music rising up
round about her from the deep, and audible to her only,
such a hearkening look as she took from the yearning
lift of her jibs and staysails.</p>

<p>Presently the captain observed me, called me to
him, and we stood in conversation for some twenty
minutes, I begged his leave to take a look round the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
ship, and he ordered a midshipman to accompany me.
I peeped into the galley or ship’s kitchen, then into
the forecastle, a gloomy cave, dully lighted by a lamp
whose vapour was poisonous with the slush that fed
it, and complicated to the landlubber’s eye by the
glimmering outlines of hammocks, and the dark, coffin-like
shapes of bunks and seamen’s chests. I then
descended into the ’tween-decks by way of the main-hatch,
and took a view of the accommodation there,
and found the cabins formed of planks roughly shaped
into bulkheads with partitions which made mere pigeon-holes
of the places. In truth the poor third-class folk
were always badly treated in those days at sea. They
were ill-housed; they were half starved; they were
elbowed, sworn at, and generally tyrannized over by
all hands, from the captain to the cook’s mate; and
in heavy weather, when the hatches were battened
down, they were almost suffocated. Yet they were
better off than the sailors, who were not only equally
half starved, half suffocated, and sworn at, but were
forced to do the treadmill work of the ship also.</p>

<p>I regained the deck, glad to get out of this gloomy
region of crying babies and quarrelling children, and
grimy groups in corners shuffling greasy cards, and
women with shawls over their heads mixing flour
and water for a pudding, or conversing shrilly in provincial
accents, some looking very white indeed, and
all as though it was quite time they changed their
country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>As I went along the quarter-deck on my way to the
cuddy, I saw a young man standing in the recess
formed by the projection of the foremost cuddy cabins
and the over-hanging ledge or break of the poop. I
looked at him with some attention; he was a particularly
handsome young fellow, chiefly remarkable
for the contrast between the lifeless pallor of his face
and the vitality of his large bright, dark eyes. His
hair was cropped close in military fashion; he wore
a cloth cap with a naval peak. His dress was a large,
loose monkey-jacket and blue cloth trousers cut in the
flowing nautical style. On the beach of Southsea or
the sands of Ramsgate he might have passed for a
yachtsman; on the high seas and on the deck of a full-rigged
ship with plenty of hairy sailors about to compare
him with, nothing mortal could have looked less
nautical.</p>

<p>I paused when in the cuddy to glance at him
again through the window. He leaned in the corner
of the recess with his arms clasped upon his breast
and his fine and sparkling eyes fixed upon the blue
line of the horizon that was visible above the lee
bulwark-rail. My gaze had lighted upon many faces
whilst I looked over the ship, but on none had it
lingered. It lingered now, and I wondered who the
youth was. His age might have been twenty; handsome
he was, as I have said, but his expression was
hard, almost fierce, and certainly repellant. Whilst I
watched him his lips twitched or writhed three or four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
times and exposed a grin of flashing white teeth that
was anything but mirthful, I can assure you. His
clothes were good, his appearance refined, and I concluded
that he was one of the cuddy passengers who
had come on board at Gravesend. He turned his face
and saw me looking, and instantly made a step which
carried him out of sight, past the cabin projection.</p>

<p>The steward came up out of the steerage at that
moment, and wishing to know who was who in the
ship I asked him to peep through the door and tell me
who the melancholy pale-faced young gentleman in
the nautical clothes was. He popped his head out and
then said—</p>

<p>“He’s a young gent named John Burgess, one of
the steerage people. He occupies the foremost cabin
to starboard beside the foot of them steps,” said he,
pointing to the hatch.</p>

<p>“Is he alone in the ship?” said I.</p>

<p>“All alone, sir.”</p>

<p>“Where do those steerage people take their meals?”</p>

<p>“Why, in the steerage, at the table that stops short
abreast of your cabin.”</p>

<p>Nothing in any way memorable happened for a
considerable time. The ship drove through the Atlantic
impelled by strong beam and quartering winds which
sometimes blew with the weight of half a gale and
veiled her forecastle with glittering lifts of foam and
heeled her till her lee-channels ripped through the seas
in flashings fierce as the white water which leaps from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
the strokes of the thrasher’s flails. The passengers
had settled down to the routine of shipboard life. They
played the piano, they sang, they hove the deck
quoit, they formed themselves into whist parties. Both
Captain Norton-Savage and his wife promised to become
exceedingly popular with all the people who lived aft.
The lady sang sweetly; she sang Spanish, English,
and French songs. It was understood that she was
a South American, of pure Spanish blood on one side.
Captain Norton-Savage told a good story. He smoked
excellent cigars and was liberal with them. He came
to me one day and talked about his wife, told me
there was consumption in her family, and asked what
I thought of a sea voyage for her and of the climate
of Australia. I could find nothing to object to in the
man except his stare. There was something defiant
in his manner of looking at you; his speech was significant
with it even when nothing more was meant than
met the ear. I was misled at first, and sometimes
troubled myself to look under his words for his mind;
then I found out that it was his stare which was
responsible for what his language seemed to carry,
and so, with the rest of us, took him as he offered
himself.</p>

<p>And still I never felt quite easy with him, though no
man laughed louder at his humorous stories.</p>

<p>I was going one morning from my berth to the
cuddy when, at the foot of the steps which conducted
to the hatch, I met the young man called John Burgess.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
I had seen nothing of him for days. He came out
of his cabin holding his cap. Plenty of light flowed
through the hatch; he was very pale, and I thought
seemed ill, and his eyes had a wild look. He was
handsome, as I have said—at least, to my way of
thinking; but there was an evil spirit in the delicate
structure and lineaments of his face. I said “Good
morning.” He answered “Good morning” in a low
voice, but with a manner of impatience, as though he
wished me to pass on or get out of his road.</p>

<p>“Are you going to Australia for your health?” said
I, for the sake of saying something.</p>

<p>“No,” he answered.</p>

<p>“Are you English?”</p>

<p>“Pray who are you?” he exclaimed with a foreign
accent.</p>

<p>“I am Dr. Harris,” I answered, smiling.</p>

<p>He looked uneasy on my pronouncing the word
<em>doctor</em>, stepped back and grasped the handle of his
cabin door, yet paused to say, “Are you a passenger,
sir?”</p>

<p>“I am the ship’s doctor,” I answered.</p>

<p>Without another word he entered his cabin and
shut the door upon himself.</p>

<p>His behaviour was so abrupt, discourteous, that I
suspected his brain was at fault. Indeed, I made up my
mind, in the interests of the passengers, and for the
security of the ship, to keep my eye upon him—that
is, by accosting him from time to time, and by watching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
him without seeming to watch whenever we should
happen to be on deck together. And yet I was not
altogether satisfied with my suspicion of his not being
right-headed, either; I found my puzzlement going
another way, but in a direction that I could by no
means make clear to myself.</p>

<p>However, not to refine upon this matter: I think
it was next day that, happening to come along from
the forecastle where I had been visiting a sick sailor,
I spied the young fellow standing before the mainmast
in a sort of peeping posture; his eyes were directed
aft; he was watching the people walking on the poop.
I stopped to look at him, struck by his attitude. The
great body of the mast effectually concealed him from
all observers aft. He turned his head and saw me;
his face was ghastly white, the expression wonderful
for the tragic wrath of it. On meeting my eyes he
coloured up, I never could have credited so swift a
transformation of hue; his blush was deep and dark
and his eyes shone like fire. He scowled angrily,
stepped round the mast, and disappeared through the
cuddy door.</p>

<p>After this I saw no more of him for a week. I
questioned the steward, who told me the youth was
keeping his cabin.</p>

<p>“What’s his name again?” said I.</p>

<p>“John Burgess, sir.”</p>

<p>“That’s an English name, but he’s not an Englishman,”
said I.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>“We don’t trouble ourselves about names on board
ship, sir,” he answered. “There be pursers’ names aft
as well as forrard.”</p>

<p>“Does he ever talk to you?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, he might be a funeral mute for talk.”</p>

<p>“Does he come to the table for his meals?”</p>

<p>“No, sir; his grub’s carried in to him.”</p>

<p>“When did you see him last?”</p>

<p>“About an hour ago.”</p>

<p>“Does he seem well?”</p>

<p>“Well as I am, sir.”</p>

<p>I asked no more questions. There was a cheerfulness
in the steward’s way of answering which
promised me he saw nothing peculiar in the lad.
This was reassuring, for I knew he was often in and
out of the young man’s berth, and anything eccentric
in his conduct would strike him. As for me, it was
no part of my duty to intrude upon the passengers
in their privacy.</p>

<p>We took the north-east trade wind, made noble progress
down the North Atlantic, lost the commercial gale
in eight or ten degrees north of the equator, and then
lay “humbugging,” as the forecastle saying is, on plains
of greasy blue water, scarcely crisped by the catspaw,
and often, for hours at a time, without air enough to
wag the fly of the vane at the masthead. One very
hot night after a day of roasting calm I lingered on the
poop for some while after my customary hour of retiring
to rest for the refreshment of the dew-cooled atmosphere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
and the cold breath lifting off the black surface of ocean.
The awning was spread over the poop; a few shadowy
figures moved slowly under it; here and there a red
star indicated a smoker sucking at a cigar; the water
alongside was full of smoky fire rolling in dim green
bursts of cloud from the bends of the ship as she leaned
with the swell. But the stars were few and faint; down
in the south-west was a little play of silent lightning;
the noises of the night were rare and weak, scarce more
than the flap of some pinion of cloth up in the gloom,
or the jerk of a wheel chain, or the subdued moan of
water washing under the counter.</p>

<p>I smoked out my pipe and still lingered; it was very
hot and I did not love the fancy of my bunk on such a
night. The passengers went below one by one after
the cabin lamps were turned down. Six bells were
struck, eleven o’clock. I took a few turns with the
officer of the watch, then went on to the quarter-deck,
where I found Captain Norton-Savage smoking and
chatting with two or three of the passengers under the
little clock against the cuddy front. The captain offered
me a cigar, our companions presently withdrew, and
we were left alone.</p>

<p>I observed a note of excitement in Captain Savage’s
speech, and guessed that the heat had coaxed him into
draining more seltzer and brandy than was good for
him. We were together till half-past eleven; his talk
was mainly anecdotic and wholly concerned others. I
asked him how his wife bore the heat. He answered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
very well, he thought. Did I not think the voyage was
doing her good? I answered I had observed her at
dinner that day and thought she looked very well in
spite of her pallor. These were the last words I spoke
before wishing him good night. He threw the end of
his cigar overboard and went to his cabin, which was
situated on the port side just over against the hatch
down which I went to my quarters in the steerage.</p>

<p>All was silent in this part. The hush upon the
deep worked in the ship like a spirit; at long intervals
only arose the faint sounds of cargo lightly strained in
the hold. Much time passed before I slept. Through
the open porthole over my bunk I could hear the mellow
chimes of the ship’s bell as it was struck. It was as
though the land lay close aboard with a church clock
chiming. The hot atmosphere was rendered doubly
disgusting by the smell of the drugs. Yea, more than
drugs, methought, went to the combined flavour. I
seemed to sniff bilgewater and the odour of the cockroach.</p>

<p>I was awakened by a hand upon my shoulder.</p>

<p>“Rouse up, for God’s sake, doctor! There’s a man
stabbed in the cuddy!”</p>

<p>I instantly got my wits, and threw my legs over the
edge of the bunk.</p>

<p>“What’s this about a man stabbed?” I exclaimed,
pulling on my clothes.</p>

<p>The person who had called me was the second mate,
Mr. Storey. He told me that he was officer of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
watch; a few minutes since one of the passengers who
slept next the berth occupied by the Savages was
awakened by a shriek. He ran into the cuddy, and at
that moment Mrs. Savage put her head out and said
that her husband lay dead with a knife buried in his
heart. The passenger rushed on deck, and Mr. Storey
came to fetch me before arousing the captain.</p>

<p>I found several people in the cuddy. The shriek of
the wife had awakened others besides the passenger
who had raised the alarm. Captain Smallport, the
commander of the ship, hastily ran out of his cabin as
I passed through the steerage hatch. Some one had
turned the cabin lamp full on, and the light was
abundant. The captain came to me, and I stepped at
once to the Savages’ berth and entered it. There was
no light here, and the cuddy lamp threw no illumination
into this cabin. I called for a box of matches and
lighted the bracket-lamp, and then there was revealed
this picture: In the upper bunk, clothed in a sleeping
costume of pyjamas and light jacket, lay the figure of
Captain Norton-Savage, with the cross-shaped hilt of a
dagger standing up out of his breast over the heart and
a dark stain of blood showing under it like its shadow.
In the right-hand corner, beside the door, stood Mrs.
Savage, in her night-dress; her face was of the whiteness
of her bedgown, her black eyes looked double their
usual size. I noticed blood upon her right hand and
a stain of blood upon her night-dress over the right
hip. All this was the impression of a swift glance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
In a step I was at Captain Savage’s side and found
him dead.</p>

<p>“Here is murder, captain,” said I, turning to the
commander of the ship.</p>

<p>He closed the door to shut out the prying passengers,
and exclaimed—</p>

<p>“Is he dead?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Savage shrieked. I observed her dressing-gown
hanging beside the door and put it on her, again
noticing the blood stains upon her hands and night-dress.
She looked horribly frightened and trembled
violently.</p>

<p>“What can you tell us about this?” said Captain
Smallport.</p>

<p>In her foreign accent, strongly defined by the passion
of terror or grief, she answered, but in such broken,
tremulous, hysteric sentences as I should be unable to
communicate in writing, that being suddenly awakened
by a noise as of her cabin door opened or shut, she
called to Captain Savage, but received no answer. She
called again, then, not knowing whether he had yet
come to bed, and the cabin being in darkness, she got
out of her bunk and felt over the upper one for
him. Her hand touched the hilt of the dagger, she
shook him and called his name, touched the dagger
again, then uttered the shriek that had alarmed the
ship.</p>

<p>“Is it suicide?” said the captain, turning to me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>I looked at the body, at the posture of the hands,
and answered emphatically, “No.”</p>

<p>I found terror rather than grief in Mrs. Savage’s
manner; whenever she directed her eyes at the corpse
I noticed the straining of panic fear in them. The
captain opened the cabin door, and called for the
stewardess. She was in waiting outside, as you may
believe. The cuddy, indeed, was full of people, and
whilst the door was open I heard the grumbling hum
of the voices of ’tween-deck passengers and seamen
crowding at the cuddy front. The news had spread
that one of the first-class passengers had been murdered,
and every tongue was asking who had done it.</p>

<p>The stewardess took Mrs. Savage to a spare cabin.
When the women were gone and the door again shut,
Captain Smallport still remaining with me, I drew the
dagger out of the breast of the body and took it to the
light. It was more properly a dagger-shaped knife than
a dagger, the point sharp as a needle, the edge razor-like.
The handle was of fretted ivory; to it was
affixed a thin slip of silver plate, on which was
engraved “Charles Winthrop Sheringham to Leonora
Dunbar.”</p>

<p>“Is it the wife’s doing, do you think?” said the
captain, looking at the dagger.</p>

<p>“I would not say ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ to that question
yet,” said I.</p>

<p>“She might have done it in her sleep.”</p>

<p>“Look at his hands,” said I. “He did not stab<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
himself. Will you take charge of this dagger, captain?”</p>

<p>“All bloody like that!” cried he, recoiling.</p>

<p>I cleansed it, and then he took it.</p>

<p>We stood conversing awhile. I examined the body
again; which done, the pair of us went out, first
extinguishing the lamp, and then locking the door.</p>

<p>The passengers sat up for the remainder of the
night, and the ship was as full of life as though the
sun had risen. In every corner of the vessel was there
a hum of talk in the subdued note into which the horror
of murder depresses the voice. The captain called his
chief officer and myself to his cabin; we inspected the
dagger afresh, and talked the dreadful thing over. Who
was the assassin? Both the captain and mate cried,
“Who but the wife?” I said I could not be satisfied
of that yet; who was Charles Winthrop Sheringham?
who was Leonora Dunbar? It was some comfort anyhow
to feel that, whoever the wretch might be, he or
she was in the ship. There were no doors to rush
through, no windows to leap from, no country to scour
<em>here</em>. The assassin was a prisoner with us all in the
ship; our business was to find out who of the whole
crowd of us had murdered the man, and we had many
weeks before us.</p>

<p>In the small hours the sailmaker and his mate
stitched up the body ready for the toss over the side
before noon. We waited until the sun had arisen, then,
our resolution having been formed, the captain and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
entered the berth which had been occupied by the
Savages and examined such baggage as we found there.
The keys were in a bag; our search lasted an hour.
At the expiration of the hour we had found out, mainly
through the agency of a large bundle of letters, but in
part also through other direct proofs, that the name of
the murdered man was Charles Winthrop Sheringham;
that the name of the lady whom he had known as Mrs.
Savage was Leonora Dunbar; that this Miss Dunbar
had been an intimate friend of Mrs. Sheringham, and
that the husband had eloped with her and taken a
passage from Melbourne in the ship <i>Chiliman</i>, promising
marriage in twenty solemn protestations on their arrival
in Australia, the ceremony to be repeated should Mrs.
Sheringham die.</p>

<p>This story we got together out of the letters and
other conclusive evidence. The captain was now
rootedly of opinion that Miss Dunbar had killed
Sheringham.</p>

<p>“It’s not only the dagger,” said he, “with her name
on it, which was therefore hers, and in her keeping
when the murder was done; for, suppose some one else
the assassin, are you to believe that he entered the
Savages’ berth and rummaged for this particular weapon
instead of using a knife of his own? How would he
know of the dagger or where to find it? It’s not the
dagger only; there’s the stains on her hand and bedgown,
and mightn’t she have killed him in a fit of
madness owing to remorse, and thoughts of a lifelong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
banishment from England, and horror of the disgrace
and shame he’s brought her to?”</p>

<p>I listened in silence; but not yet could I make up
my mind.</p>

<p>I met the stewardess coming to the captain with the
key of the Savages’ cabin; she wanted clothes for the
lady. I asked how Mrs. Savage did, giving the unhappy
woman the name she was known by on board.</p>

<p>“She won’t speak, sir,” answered the stewardess.
“She’s fallen into a stony silence. She sits with her
hands clasped and her eyes cast down, and I can’t get
a word out of her.”</p>

<p>“I’ll look in upon her by-and-by,” said I.</p>

<p>The body was buried at ten o’clock in the morning.
The captain read the funeral service, and the quarter-deck
was crowded with the passengers and crew. I
don’t think there was the least doubt throughout the
whole body of the people that Mrs. Savage, as they
supposed her, had murdered Sheringham. It was the
murder that put into this funeral service the wild,
tragic significance everybody seemed to find in it, to
judge at least by the looks on the faces I glanced at.</p>

<p>When the ceremony was ended I called for the
stewardess, and went with her to Miss Dunbar’s cabin.
On entering I requested the stewardess to leave me.
The lady was seated, and did not lift her eyes, nor
exhibit any signs of life whilst I stood looking. Her
complexion had turned into a dull pale yellow, and her
face, with its expression of hard, almost blank repose,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
might have passed for marble wantonly tinctured a dim
primrose. She had exchanged her dressing-gown for
a robe, and appeared attired as usual. I asked some
questions, but got no answer. I then took a seat by
her side, and called her by the name of Leonora Dunbar.
She now looked at me steadily, but I did not remark
any expression of strong surprise, of the alarm and
amazement I had supposed the utterance of that name
would excite.</p>

<p>I said softly, “The captain and I have discovered
who you are, and your relation with Charles Winthrop
Sheringham. Was it you who stabbed him? Tell me
if you did it. Your sufferings will be the lighter when
you have eased your conscience of the weight of the
dreadful secret.”</p>

<p>It is hard to interpret the expression of the eyes if
the rest of the features do not help. I seemed to find
a look of hate and contempt in hers. Her face continued
marble hard. Not being able to coax a syllable
out of her, though I spared nothing of professional
patience in the attempt, I left the cabin, and, calling
the stewardess, bade her see that the lady was kept
without means to do herself a mischief.</p>

<p>That day and the next passed. Miss Dunbar continued
dumb as a corpse. I visited her several times,
and twice Captain Smallport accompanied me; but
never a word would she utter. Nay, she would not
even lift her eyes to look at us. I told the captain that
it might be mere mulishness or a condition of mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
that would end in madness. It was impossible to say.
The stewardess said she ate and drank and went obediently
to bed when ordered. She was as passive as a
broken-spirited child, she said. For her part she didn’t
believe the lady had killed the poor man.</p>

<p>It was on the fourth day following the murder that
the glass fell; it blackened in the north-west, and came
on to blow a hard gale of wind. A mountainous sea was
running in a few hours upon which the ship made
furious weather, clothed in flying brine to her tops,
under no other canvas than a small storm main-trysail.
The hatches were battened down, the decks were full of
water, which flashed in clouds of glittering smoke over
the lee bulwark rail. The passengers for the most part
kept their cabins. The cook could do no cooking; indeed
the galley fire was washed out, and we appeased our
appetites with biscuit and tinned meat.</p>

<p>The gale broke at nine o’clock on the following
morning, leaving a wild, confused sea and a scowling
sky all round the horizon, with ugly yellow breaks over
our reeling mastheads. I was in my gloomy quarters,
whose atmosphere was little more than a green twilight,
with the wash of the emerald brine swelling in thunder
over the porthole, when the steward arrived to tell me
that one of the passengers had met with a serious
accident. I asked no questions, but instantly followed
him along the steerage corridor into the cuddy, where I
found a group of the saloon people standing beside the
figure of the young fellow named John Burgess, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
lay at his length upon the deck. I had not set eyes on
him for days and days.</p>

<p>I thought at first he was dead. His eyes were half
closed; the glaze of approaching dissolution was in
the visible part of the pupils, and at first I felt no
pulse. Two or three of the sailors who had brought
him into the cuddy stood in the doorway. They told
me that the young fellow had persisted in mounting
the forecastle ladder to windward. He was hailed to
come down, as the ship was pitching heavily and often
dishing bodies of green water over her bows. He
took no notice of the men’s cries, and had gained
the forecastle-deck when an unusually heavy lurch
flung him; he fell from a height of eight or nine feet,
which might have broken a limb for him only; unhappily
he struck the windlass end, and lay seemingly
lifeless.</p>

<p>I bade them lift and carry him to the cabin that I
might examine him, and when they had placed him in
his bunk I told them to send the steward to help me and
went to work to partially unclothe the lad to judge of
his injuries.</p>

<p>On opening his coat I discovered that he was a
woman.</p>

<p>On the arrival of the steward I told him that the
young fellow called John Burgess was a girl, and I
requested him to send the stewardess, and whilst
I waited for her I carefully examined the unconscious
sufferer, and judged that she had received mortal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
internal injuries. All the while that I was thus
employed some extraordinary thoughts ran in my
head.</p>

<p>The stewardess came. I gave her certain directions
and went to the captain to report the matter. He was
in no wise surprised to learn that a woman dressed as
a man was aboard his ship; twice, he told me, had that
sort of passenger sailed with him within the last four
years.</p>

<p>“Captain,” said I, “I’ll tell you what’s in my head!
That woman below who styled herself John Burgess
murdered Sheringham.”</p>

<p>“Why do you think that?”</p>

<p>“Because I believe that she’s his wife.”</p>

<p>“Ha!” said Captain Smallport.</p>

<p>I gave several reasons for this notion; what I observed
in the disguised woman’s behaviour when hidden behind
the mainmast; then her being a foreigner, in all probability
a South American, as Leonora Dunbar was, and
so on.</p>

<p>He said, “What about the blood on Miss Dunbar’s
hand and night-dress?”</p>

<p>“She told us she had felt over the body.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes!” he cried, “doctor, you see things more
clearly than I do.”</p>

<p>When I had conversed for some time with Captain
Smallport, I walked to Miss Dunbar’s cabin, knocked,
and entered. I found her on this occasion standing
with her back to the door, apparently gazing at the sea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
through the portholes; she did not turn her head. I
stood beside her to see her face and said—</p>

<p>“I have made a discovery; Mrs. Sheringham is on
board this ship.”</p>

<p>On my pronouncing these words she screamed, and
looked at me with a face in which I clearly read that
her silence had been sheer sullen mulish obstinacy, with
nothing of insanity in it, pure stubborn determination
to keep silence that we might think what we chose.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Sheringham in this ship?” she cried, with
starting eyes and the wildest, whitest countenance you
can imagine.</p>

<p>“Yes,” I answered.</p>

<p>“Then it’s she who murdered Sheringham. She is
capable of it, she is a tigress!” she cried in a voice
pitched to the note of a scream.</p>

<p>“That’s what I have come to talk to you about, and
I am glad you have found your voice.”</p>

<p>“Where is she?” she asked, and a strong shudder
ran through her.</p>

<p>“She is in her cabin below, dying; she may be dead
even now as we converse.”</p>

<p>She uttered something in Spanish passionately and
clasped her hands.</p>

<p>“Now hear me,” said I, “since you have your ears
and have found your tongue. You are suspected of
having murdered the man you eloped with.”</p>

<p>“It is false!” she shrieked. “I loved him—oh, I
loved him!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>She caught her breath and wept bitterly.</p>

<p>“In my own heart,” said I, touched by her dreadful
misery, “I believe you guiltless. I am sure you are so
now that we have discovered that Mrs. Sheringham is
on board. Will you answer a question?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she sobbed.</p>

<p>“You know that Sheringham was stabbed to the
heart with a dagger?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“It bears this inscription: ‘<i>Charles Winthrop Sheringham
to Leonora Dunbar.</i>’ Was that dagger in your
possession in this ship?”</p>

<p>“No. Mr. Sheringham gave it to me. There was
no such inscription as you name upon it. I left it
behind when I came away. I swear before my God I
speak the truth!”</p>

<p>Her voice was broken with sobs; she spoke with
deepest agitation. Her manner convinced me it was
as she represented.</p>

<p>I said, “Come with me and see the woman and
tell me if she is Mrs. Sheringham.”</p>

<p>She shrank and cried out that she could not go.
She was perfectly sane: all her stubbornness was gone
from her; she was now a miserable, scared, broken-hearted
woman. I told her that the person I took to be
Mrs. Sheringham lay insensible and perhaps dead at
this moment, and, by putting on an air of command, I
succeeded at last in inducing, or rather obliging, her to
accompany me. She veiled herself before quitting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
cabin. The saloon was empty. We passed into the
steerage, and she followed me into the cabin where
the woman was.</p>

<p>The poor creature was still unconscious; the
stewardess stood beside the bunk looking at its dying
white occupant. I said to Miss Dunbar—</p>

<p>“Is it Mrs. Sheringham?”</p>

<p>She was cowering at the door, but when she perceived
that the woman lay without motion with her eyes half
closed, insensible and, perhaps, dead, as she might
suppose, she drew near the bunk, peered breathlessly,
and then, looking around to me, said—</p>

<p>“She is Mrs. Sheringham. Let me go!”</p>

<p>I opened the door and she fled with a strange noise
of sobbing.</p>

<p>I stayed for nearly three hours in Mrs. Sheringham’s
berth. There was nothing to be done for her. She
passed away in her unconsciousness, and afterwards,
when I looked more closely into the nature of her
injuries, I wondered that she could have lived five
minutes after the terrible fall that had beaten sensibility
out of her over the windlass end.</p>

<p>I went to the captain to report her death, and in a
long talk I gave him my views of the tragic business.
I said there could be no question that Mrs. Sheringham
had followed the guilty couple to sea with a determination
so to murder her husband as to fix the crime of his
death upon his paramour. How was this to be done?
Her discovery at her home of the dagger her husband<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
had given to Leonora Dunbar would perhaps give her the
idea she needed. If Miss Dunbar spoke the truth, then,
indeed, I could not account for the inscription on the
dagger. But there could be no question whatever that
Mrs. Sheringham had been her husband’s murderess.</p>

<p>This was my theory: and it was afterwards verified
up to the hilt. On the arrival of the <i>Chiliman</i> at
Melbourne Miss Dunbar was sent home to take her trial
for the murder of Mr. Sheringham; but her innocence
was established by—first, the circumstance of a woman
having been found aboard dressed as a man; next, by
the statement of witnesses that a woman whose appearance
exactly corresponded with that of “John Burgess”
had been the rounds of the shipping offices to inspect
the list of passengers by vessels bound to Australia;
thirdly, by letters written to Leonora Dunbar by Sheringham
found among Mrs. Sheringham’s effects, in one
of which the man told the girl that he proposed to carry
her to Australia. Finally, and this was the most
conclusive item in the whole catalogue of evidence, an
engraver swore that a woman answering to Mrs.
Sheringham’s description called upon him with the
dagger (produced in court) and requested him without
delay to inscribe upon the thin plate, “Charles Winthrop
Sheringham to Leonora Dunbar.”</p>

<p>And yet, but for the death of Mrs. Sheringham and
my discovery of her sex, it was far more likely than not
that the wife would have achieved her aim by killing her
husband and getting her rival hanged for the murder.</p>

<h2 id="THE_SECRET_OF_THE_DEAD_MATE"><i>THE SECRET OF THE DEAD MATE.</i></h2>

<p>Black in the wake of the moon, in the heart of the
trembling spread of white splendour, floated a boat.
The night was breathless: beyond the verge of the
eclipsing brightness of the moon the sky was full of
stars. A man sat in the stern-sheets of the boat
motionless with his chin on his breast and his arms
in lifeless posture beside him. From time to time
he groaned, and after he had been sitting as though
dead for an hour he raised his head and lifted up
his eyes to the moon, and cursed the thirst that was
burning his throat, then shifted his figure close to
the gunwale, over which he lay, with both hands in
the water for the chill of it.</p>

<p>The moonshine was nigh as bright as day. The
sea-line ran firm as a sweep of painted circle through
the silver mist in the far recesses. An oar was stepped
as a mast in the boat, and athwart it was lashed
another oar from which hung a man’s shirt and coat.
She looked dry as a midsummer ditch in that piercing
moonlight. At the feet of the man, distinctly visible,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
were two or three little pellets or lumps of rag, which
he had been chewing throughout the day; but his
jaws were now locked, the saliva had run dry, his
sailor’s teeth, blunted by junk and ship’s bread, could
bite no more moisture out of the fragment of stuff
he had cut off his back. Oh! it is dreadful to suffer
the agony of thirst, the froth, the baked and cracking
lip, the strangled throat, whilst beholding a vast breast
of cold sea glazed into the beauty of ice by the moon,
and whilst hearing the fountain-like murmur and
refreshing ripple of water alongside!</p>

<p>The moon rolled slowly into the south-west, trailing
her bright wake with her, and the boat and its solitary
occupant floated into the shadow. Again the man
lifted his head and looked around him. A soft breeze,
but hot as the human breath, was blowing, and the
shirt and coat dangling from the athwartship oar were
lifting to the light pressure. The man saw that the
boat was moving over the sea, but made no attempt
to help her with the helm; once more he cast his eyes
up at the moon and cursed the thirst that was choking
him. But a boat, like a ship, has a life and a spirit
of her own. The little fabric ran as though, with the
sentience of a living organism, she knew there was
something to hope for in the darkness ahead; her
wake was a short, arrow-like line, and it streamed
from her in emerald bubbles and circling wreaths of
fire.</p>

<p>The sun rose, and the shadow of the earth rolled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
off the sea, which was feathering into the south-west
to the steady pouring of the north-east wind. The
boat ran straight, and now, the day being come, when
the man looked up and ahead, he saw the shadow
of land over the bows. Life sprang up in him with
the sight, and a grin of hope twisted his face. With a
husky groan he shifted himself for a grasp of the helm,
and, laying his trembling hand upon the tiller, he held
the boat—but not more steadily than she had been
going—for the land.</p>

<p>He was a man of about forty-five years of age;
half his clothes were aloft, and he was attired in
fearnaught trousers of the boatman’s pattern, and a
waistcoat buttoned over his vest. Suffering had sifted
a pallor into the sun-brown of his skin, and his face
was ghastly with famine and thirst. His short yellow
beard stood straight out. His yellow hair was mixed
with grey, and lay clotted with the sweat of pain into
long streaks over his brow and ears, covering his eyes
as though he was too weak or heedless to clear his
vision.</p>

<p>The speed of the boat quickly raised the land,
and by noon under the roasting sun it lay within a
mile. It was one of the Bahama Cays—a flat island,
with a low hill in the midst of it, to the right of which
was a green wood; the rest of the island was green
with some sort of tropic growth as of guinea-grass.
The breeze was now very light—the sun had eaten
it up, as the Spaniards say. The man thought he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
saw the sparkle of a waterfall, and the sight made
him mad, and as strong in that hour as in his heartiest
time. He sprang from his seat, pulled down his queer
fabric of oar and flapping shirt and coat, and flinging
the two blades over, bent his back and drove the boat
along. In a quarter of an hour her forefoot grounded
on a coral-white beach that swept round a point clear
of the foam of the breaker, and the man reeling out
of her on to the shore, grasped her painter, and secured
it to an oar, which he jammed into a thickness of
some sort of bush that grew close to the wash of the
water, and then, rocking and stumbling, he went up
the beach.</p>

<p>It was an uninhabited island, and nothing was in
sight upon the whole circle of the white shining sea
saving the dim blue haze of land in the north and a
like film or delicate discoloration of the atmosphere
in the south-west. The man with rounded back and
hanging arms and staggering gait searched for water.
The heat was frightful; the sunshine blazed in the
white sand, and seemed to strike upwards into the face
in darting and tingling needles, white hot. He went
towards the wood, wading painfully on his trembling
legs through the guinea-grass and thick undergrowth,
with toadstools in it like red shields and astir with
armoured creatures, finger-long reptiles of glorious hue,
and spiders like bunches of jewels.</p>

<p>Suddenly he stopped; his ears had caught a distant
noise of water; he turned his back upon the sun, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
thrusting onwards, came presently to a little stream,
in which the grass stood thick, green, and sweet. He
fell on his knees, and, putting his lips to the crystal
surface, sucked up the water like a horse, till, being
full nearly to bursting, he fell back with a moan of
gratitude, his face hidden in his hands. He sat till
the broiling sunshine forced him to rise. The slender
stream narrowed in the direction of the wood, and he
walked beside it; presently, after pushing a little way
into the green shade, he found the source in a rock rich
with verdure and enamelled with many strange and
beautiful flowers. The trees in this wood stood well
apart, but their branches mingled in many places, and
the shade they made was nearly continuous.</p>

<p>He threw himself down beside the source of the little
stream to rest himself. The surf seethed with a
noise of boiling through the silent, blazing atmosphere
outside. The miserable castaway now directed his eyes
round in search of food. He saw several kinds of
berries, and things like apples, but durst not eat of
them for fear of being poisoned. Being now rested
and immeasurably refreshed, he cooled his head in the
stream and walked to the beach, and picked up a
number of crabs. He saw to his boat, hauling her
almost high and dry. All that she contained besides
the clothes which had served him for a sail, was a
carpenter’s hammer and a bag of spikes. He whipped
off his waistcoat and put his coat on, and dropping
the hammer into his pocket, returned to the wood with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
his collection of crabs; then with his knife he cut
down a quantity of dry brushwood and set fire to it
with the old-fashioned tinder-box that seamen of this
man’s rating sometimes carried in those days to light
their pipes. He roasted the crabs artfully, as one who
has served an apprenticeship to hardship, and having
eaten, he drank again, and then folded his arms to
consider what he should do.</p>

<p>He knew that the island was one of the Bahama
Cays, though which he could not imagine. But other
islands were in sight. He guessed that New Providence
was not out of reach of his boat, nor was the Florida
coast remote, and then there was all the traffic of
the Gulf of Mexico. He determined, whilst he reflected,
to cook plenty of crabs and to seek for turtle, and so
store himself with provisions. But how about watering
his little craft? Fresh water, cold and sweet, there
was in plenty, but he had nothing to put it in, and
what could he contrive or invent to serve as a breaker?
He thought to himself, if he could find cocoanuts he
would let the milk drain, and fill the fruit with water,
and so carry away enough to last him until he should
be picked up or make a port.</p>

<p>He cast his eyes up aloft with a fancy of beholding
in the trees something growing that would answer his
purpose, and started, still looking and staring, as
though fascinated or lightning-struck.</p>

<p>His eye had sought a tree whose long lower branches
overshadowed the little stream, and amidst the foliage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
he thought he saw the figure of a man! The shape
jockeyed a bough; its back was upon the tree; and
now, straining his vision steadily under the sharp of
his hand, the man saw that it was the skeleton of a
human being, apparently lashed or secured to the
bough, and completely clothed, from the sugar-loaf hat
upon his skull down to the rusty yellow sea-boats which
dangled amidst the leaves.</p>

<p>The sailor was alone, and the ghastly sight shocked
him; the sense of his loneliness was intensified by it;
he thought he had been cast away upon the principality
of death himself. The diabolic grin in the tree froze
the blood in his veins, and for awhile he could do no
more than stare and mutter fragments of the Lord’s
Prayer.</p>

<p>He guessed from the costume that the figure had
been lodged for a great number of years in that tree.
He recollected that when he was a boy he had seen
foreign seamen dressed as that skeleton up there was.
It was now late in the afternoon, and with a shuddering
glance aloft he began to consider how and where he
should sleep. He walked out of the wood and gained
the highest point of the little central hill, and looked
about him for a sail. There was nothing in sight,
saving the dim shadows of land red in the ether of
sunset. The skeleton, as though it had been a devil,
took possession of the castaway’s soul. He could think
of nothing else—not even of how he was to get away,
how he was to store fresh water for his voyage. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
did not mean to sleep in a tree: but the leaves provided
a roof as sheltering as an awning, and he determined to
lie down in the wood, and take his chance of snakes.
Yet, before he could rest, he must have the skeleton out
of it: the shadows would be frightful with the fancy of
that figure above riding the bough and rattling its
bones to every sigh of wind.</p>

<p>So with a resolved heart made desperate by superstition
and fear, the sailor walked to the wood, and
coming to the tree, climbed it by the aid of the strong
tendrils of parasites which lay coiled round the trunk
stout and stiff as ropes. He bestrode a thick bough
close to the skeleton. It was a ghastly sight in that
green glimmering dusk, darkening swiftly with the
sinking of the sun. The flesh of the face was gone;
the cloak hanging from the shoulders was lean, dusty,
ragged as any twelfth-century banner drooping motionless
in the gloom of a cathedral. The sailor saw that
time and weather had rotted everything saving the
bones of the thing. It was secured to the bough by
what was, or had been, a scarf, as though the man
had feared to fall in his sleep. The seaman stretched
forth his hand, and to the first touch the scarf parted
as though it had been formed of smoke; the figure
reeled, dropped, and went to pieces at the foot of
the tree.</p>

<p>The sailor had not expected this. He was almost
afraid to descend. When he reached the ground he
fled towards his boat, and lay in her all night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>He went for a drink of water at daybreak, and
passing the scattered remains of the skeleton—with
some degree of heart, for daylight brought courage, and
a few hours of sleep had given him confidence—he spied
something glittering amongst the rags of the skeleton’s
apparel. He picked it up. It was a silver snuff-box.
He opened it, and inside found a piece of paper folded
to the shape of the box. It was covered with a scrawl
in pencil, faint, yet decipherable. To the man it would
have been all one, whether the writing had been Chinese
or English: he could not read. But he was a wary
and cunning old sailor; every instinct of perception
and suspicion was set a-crawling by the sight of this
queer faintly pencilled document, and by the look of
the silver snuff-box which weighed very handsomely in
his horny palm, yellow with tar. He pocketed the toy,
and having refreshed himself with a drink of water,
returned to the fragments of wearing apparel and old
bones, no longer afraid, and with the handle of his
hammer turned the stuff over, and in the course of
a few minutes met with and pocketed the following
articles: a stump of common lead pencil, three pieces
of silver Spanish money, a clay pipe mounted in silver
in the bone of an albatross’s wing, a silver watch and
hair guard, and a small gold cross.</p>

<p>He talked to himself with a composed countenance
as he examined these trifles; then, having hunted after
more relics to no purpose, he turned his back upon the
bones and rags, and went about the business of the day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>During the morning he collected many crabs, but all
the while he could not imagine how he was to carry
away a store of water, till, chancing to look along the
brilliant curve of beach, he spied a turtle of about three
hundred pounds coming out of the sea, and then he
made up his mind to turn a turtle over after dark, and
cut its throat, and make a tub of the shell.</p>

<p>Happily for this castaway he was spared the distress
of passing another night upon the island. Two or three
hours before sundown, a steady breeze then blowing
from the north, a large schooner suddenly rounded the
western point of the island at the distance of a couple of
miles, heading east, and steering so as to keep the
island fair abeam. The man had collected plenty of
brushwood to roast his crabs with; he swiftly kindled a
fire, and made a smoke with damp leaves, and whilst
this signal was feathering down the wind, he launched
and jumped into his boat, and, with the nimble experienced
hands of the seaman, crossed his oars and set
his sail of shirt and coat, and slowly blew away right
before the wind towards the schooner. She saw the
smoke and then the boat, and hove to, and in three-quarters
of an hour the man was aboard.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” said the master of the schooner,
when the man stood upon the deck.</p>

<p>“Christian Hawke, carpenter of the <i>Morning Star</i>,”
he answered.</p>

<p>“What’s become of your ship?” said the other.</p>

<p>“Don’t know,” answered Hawke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>“What’s your yarn?”</p>

<p>“Why,” answered Hawke, speaking in a hoarse
level growling voice, “we was becalmed, and the captain
told me to get into a boat and nail a piece of copper,
which had worked loose, on the rudder. We was flying-light.”</p>

<p>“Where from?” said the captain, suspiciously.</p>

<p>“From New Orleans to Havannah, for orders.”</p>

<p>“Well?” said the captain.</p>

<p>“Well,” continued Hawke, “I was hammering away
all right, and doing my bit, when a squall came along,
and the ship, with a kick-up of her stern, let go the
painter of her own accord and bolted into the thickness;
’twas like muck when that squall bursted, with me a-hollering;
I lost sight of the vessel, and should have
been a dead man if it hadn’t been for that there island.”
After a pause. “What island is it, sir?” he asked.</p>

<p>“An island fifteen mile east of Rum Cay,” answered
the captain.</p>

<p>Hawke had got it into his head that the paper in the
snuff-box was the record of a treasure secret, but he was
afraid to exhibit it and ask questions. He did not know
in what language it was written, whether, in fact, it
might not be in good English, and he thought if he
showed the paper and it proved a confession of money-burial,
or something of that sort, the man who read it,
knowing where the island was, would forestall him.</p>

<p>On the arrival of the schooner at Kingston, Jamaica,
Christian Hawke went ashore. He was without money<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
or clothes, and at once sold the skeleton’s watch and
hair guard, for which he received thirty dollars. The
purchaser of the watch looked at Hawke curiously
across the counter after paying down the money, and
said—</p>

<p>“Vere did you get this?”</p>

<p>“It’s a family hairloom,” answered Hawke, pointing
to the watchguard with a singular grin.</p>

<p>“This here vatch,” said Mr. Solomons, “is a
hundred year old, and a vast curiosity in her vurks.
Have you more of this sort of thing to sell? If so, I
was the most liberal dealer of any man in Jamaica.”</p>

<p>Hawke gave him a nod and walked out. He found a
ship next morning and signed articles as carpenter and
second mate. She was sailing for England in a week
from that date, and was a plump, old-fashioned barque
of four hundred tons. At the sailors’ lodging-house he
had put up at he fell into conversation one evening, a
day or two before he sailed, with a dark, black-eyed,
handsome, intelligent foreign seaman, who called himself
simply Pedro. This fellow did not scruple to hint
at experiences gained both as a contrabandist and
piccaroon.</p>

<p>“D’ye speak many languages?” said Hawke, puffing
at a long clay pipe, and casting his grave, slow-moving
little eyes upon a tumbler of amber rum at his elbow.</p>

<p>“I can speak three or four languages,” said the
foreign seaman.</p>

<p>Hawke surveyed him thoughtfully and then, putting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
down his pipe, thrust his hand in his pocket, and extracted
the paper from the snuff-box without exposing
the box.</p>

<p>“What language is this wrote in?” said he, handing
the paper to his companion.</p>

<p>The man looked at it, frowning with the severity of
his gaze, so dim was the pencil scrawl, so queer the
characters, as though the handwriting were the march
of a spider’s legs over the page. He then exclaimed
suddenly, “Yes, I have it. It is my own language.
It is Spanish.”</p>

<p>“Ha!” exclaimed Hawke, “and what’s it all about,
mate?”</p>

<p>“How did you come by it?” said the man.</p>

<p>“Found it in an old French Testament,” answered
Hawke.</p>

<p>The man glanced at him, and then fixed his eyes
upon the paper and began to read. He read very slowly,
with difficulty deciphering the Spanish, and with greater
difficulty interpreting it. The two men were alone. The
foreign seaman made out the writing to signify this:—</p>

<p>“I who write am Luis de Argensola, that was second
in command of the <i>Gil Polo</i>, commanded by Leonardo
de Leon. In a terrible hurricane the ship that was
bound from the Havannah to old Spain was lost. I
escaped in a boat with Dona Mariana de Mesa and two
seamen; both men went mad, and cast themselves overboard
in the night. The Dona Mariana was my cousin.
She was following her husband to Madrid. He had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
preceded her by two months. She had many valuable
jewels, the gift of her husband, and some had been for
many centuries in possession of her own family, who
were nobles of Spain. Before the ship foundered the
Dona urged me to save these jewels, which were in a
box in her cabin. I found the box and threw it
into the boat, and shortly afterwards the ship went
down.</p>

<p>“After five days of anguish we arrived at a little
island, and twenty-four hours afterwards the Dona
Mariana expired. I had no spade to dig a grave, and
placed her body in a cave on the left-hand side of a
little bay opposite the wood or grove where the fresh
water stream begins. I have now been here six weeks,
and have beheld no ship, and am without hope and feel
as a dying man. Oh, stranger, who shall discover this
my writing, to your honour as a man and to your charity
as a Christian do I appeal. My own bones may rest in
the place where I die—I care not, but I entreat that the
remains of the Dona Mariana may be enclosed in a box,
and carefully conveyed for interment to her relatives at
Madrid, and that this may prove no profitless duty to
him who undertakes it, behold! in the foot of the tree I
am accustomed to climb at night, that I may sleep free
from the sting of the scorpion, you shall find a hole.
There, within easy reach of your hand lies the box of
jewels. This box and the remains of Dona Mariana I
entreat of your Christian charity to convey to Alonzo
Reyes, Villagarcia, Spain, and I pledge the honour of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
Spaniard that one-half the value of the jewels shall be
given to you.—<span class="smcap">Luis de Argensola</span>. July, 1840.”</p>

<p>“That’s twenty year ago,” said Hawke, sucking at
his pipe.</p>

<p>“What’ll you take for the secret?” said his
companion.</p>

<p>“Eh!”</p>

<p>“If I can find some one to help you to recover those
jewels, what share will you give me?”</p>

<p>Hawke pocketed the paper with a sour smile and
went out of the room.</p>

<p>His ship sailed and all went well with her. On his
arrival in England, as soon as he had taken up his
wages and purchased a suit of clothes, he went down to
Ramsgate, where, in a little off street not far from the
entrance to the pier, dwelt his brother Reuben. This
man was by trade a boat-builder. He also owned some
bathing-machines. The brothers had not met for some
years, nor had they heard from or of each other since
they were last together. Yet when Christian, after
beating with a little brass knocker upon a little green
door, turned the handle and entered straight into a
dwelling-room, his brother Reuben, who sat at tea with
his wife, two girls, and his wife’s grandfather, exhibited
no surprise. Their greeting was simply, “Hallo,
Christian!” “Well, Rube!”</p>

<p>Christian sat down and partook of tea with the
family, and related his adventures to the great entertainment
of the grandfather, who laughed till his cheeks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
were wet at all the pathetic parts—such as Hawke’s
description of his thirst and his feelings of loneliness
when upon the ocean and when lying in the boat at the
island. The women cleared away the tea-things and
went out; the old grandfather fell asleep; then said
Christian to his brother—</p>

<p>“Rube, I’m down here to have an airnest chat along
with yer.”</p>

<p>“So I guessed,” said Reuben, who resembled his
brother in face, manner, and tone of voice.</p>

<p>“Still got that cutter o’ yourn?”</p>

<p>“D’yer mean the <i>Petrel</i>?”</p>

<p>“Ay.”</p>

<p>“Yes, she’s a-lying in the west gully. She airnt me
some good money last year as a pleasure-boat. I’ve
been thinking of sending her out a-fishing.”</p>

<p>“What’s her tonnage?”</p>

<p>“Eighteen. Want to buy her, Christian?”</p>

<p>“Not I. Suppose you and me goes down and takes
a look at her.”</p>

<p>Reuben put on his coat and cap, and the brothers
issued forth. Two square figures, the shoregoer rolling
in his gait like the seafarer, as though, in fact, he was
as fresh from the heave of the sea as the other. They
walked along the pier till they came abreast of a stout
little cutter lying at her moorings in the thick of a fleet
of smacks hailing from Gravelines, Penzance, and other
places. Christian viewed her in silence with the critical
eye of an old sailor and a ship’s carpenter to boot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>“How old’s she, Rube?”</p>

<p>“Nine year.”</p>

<p>“She’ll do,” said Christian. “Rube, I’m going to
spin yer a yarn.”</p>

<p>They went leisurely along the pier, and as they
walked Christian told his brother about the skeleton in
the tree and the document in Spanish which he had
found in the dead man’s snuff-box. He produced the
snuff-box and the paper, also the clay pipe mounted in
the bone of an albatross’s wing, and the small gold
cross. Reuben listened with an eye bright and keen
with interest and conviction. The mere sight of the
silver box was as convincing to his mind as though he
had been carried to the island, and stood looking at
Argensola’s bones and the hole in the tree in which the
box of jewels lay hid.</p>

<p>That night the two brothers sat up late, deep
in discourse. Christian put ten pounds upon the
table.</p>

<p>“That’s all I own in the world,” said he. “It’ll
help to victual the boat.”</p>

<p>“We shall want a navigator,” said Reuben. “I’m
rather ignorant, myself, of that art, and I don’t suppose
you’ve learnt yourself to read yet, ha’ ye, Christian?
There’s young Bob Maxted knows all about shooting of
the sun. Us two and him’ll be hands enough. Shall
we make shares?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Christian; “you and me divides.
T’other’ll come along on wages.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>“There’s no doubt about the situation of the island,
I suppose?” said Reuben.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Let’s look at that there Spanish writing again.”</p>

<p>Christian produced the snuff-box and Reuben opened
the paper.</p>

<p>“Are you cocksure,” said Reuben, fastening his
eyes upon the dim scrawl, “that that there Pedro, as
you call him, gave you the right meaning of this
writing?”</p>

<p>“Yes; and there was my own ixpurrience to back
his varsion.”</p>

<p>“I’m rather for having it made into English again,
Christian,” said Reuben, thoughtfully. “Young Jones
down at Consul Hammond’s office speaks Spanish.
What d’yer say?”</p>

<p>“No; I’m not a-going to trust any man but yourself
with the secret. See here: if we come back rich—as’ll
follow—and you’ve bin meanwhile and shown that
there paper to some one who understands it, what’ll be
thought? The gaff’ll be blowed; the relaytives of that
there Mary Ann’ll be getting wind of our haul, and’ll
come upon us for the jewels.”</p>

<p>This and the like reasoning satisfied Reuben, who
presently returned the paper to Christian, and, after
drinking a final glass of grog, the two brothers went
to bed.</p>

<p>Next day, and for some days afterwards, they were
full of business. Young Maxted was willing to sail with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
them; they gave out vaguely that they were bound to
the West Indies, partly on pleasure, partly on business.
The true character of their errand was not revealed to
Maxted, who had agreed for six pounds a month to
navigate the little ship into the West Indian seas and
back again. Reuben drew all his savings from the
bank; twenty pounds and Christian’s ten pounds formed
their capital. They provisioned themselves with forecastle
fare, adding some bottled beer and a few gallons
of rum, and on a fine morning at daybreak, when
Ramsgate still slumbered, and the hush of the night yet
brooded over the harbour, the three men hoisted their
mainsail and jib, and blew softly down the gulley and
round the head of the pier into the English Channel,
which was by this time white with the risen sun, and
beautiful in the south-west, where a hundred ships that
had lain wind-bound in the Downs were flashing into
canvas, and moving like a cloud before the light easterly
breeze.</p>

<p>All went well down-Channel with the little craft.
She was a stout and buoyant sea boat, with a dominant
sheer of bow, coppered to the bends like a revenue
cutter, and uncommonly stout of scantling for a vessel
of her class. She was in good trim, and she plunged
along stoutly, making fine weather of some ugly seas
which ridged to her bow as she drove aslant through the
Bay. By this time young Maxted had been made
acquainted with the cutter’s destination, and was
steering a course for the little island. He plied his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
sextant nimbly, and clearly understood his business.
The brothers represented to him that the object of their
voyage was to recover some treasure which had been
washed ashore out of a small Spanish plate ship and
buried.</p>

<p>“We ain’t sure,” Christian Hawke told him, “that
the island we’re bound to is the island where the wreck
took place. But the herrant’s worth the cost and the
time, and we mean to have a look round, anyhow.”</p>

<p>Maxted was silent; perhaps with the proverbial
heedlessness of the sailor he was satisfied to take things
as they happened. The actual motive of the voyage
could be of no interest to him. All that he had to do
was to steer the little ship to an island and receive so
many sovereigns in wages on their return.</p>

<p>They made a swift run for so small a keel; in fact,
the island was in sight at the grey of dawn thirty-three
days after the start from Ramsgate. Christian Hawke
with a telescope at his eye quickly recognized the
central hill, the soft, cloud-like mass of green shadow
made by the wood or grove on the right, and the slope
of the green land to the ivory dazzle of sand vanishing
in the foam of the charging comber. He warmly commended
Maxted’s navigation, and both brothers stared
with flushed faces and nostrils wide with expectation at
the beautiful little cay that lay floating like a jewel full
of gleams upon the calm blue brine right ahead.</p>

<p>They hove-to and rounded at about a mile from the
land, and then let go their anchor in sixteen fathoms of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
water. They next launched their little fat jolly-boat
smack-fashion through the gangway, and Christian and
Reuben entered her and pulled away for the land,
leaving Maxted in charge of the cutter; but little
vigilance was needed in such weather as that; the sea
was flat, and bare, and as brilliant as the sky; under
the sun the water trembled in a glory of diamonds to
the delicate brushing of a hot, light breeze. Nothing
broke the silence upon the deep save the low, organ-like
music of the surf beating on the western and northern
boards of the island.</p>

<p>Whilst Christian pulled, Reuben steering the boat
with an oar, he talked of his sufferings when in these
parts, how his jaws had been fixed in a horrid gape by
thirst, and of the terror that had besieged him when he
looked up into the trees and beheld the skeleton. They
made direct for the little creek into which Christian had
driven his boat, and where he had slept on that first
and only night he had passed on the island; and when
her forefoot grounded they sprang out and hauled the
boat high and dry, and then with hearts loud in their
ears and restless eyes, directed their steps towards the
little wood. Christian glanced wildly about him,
imagining that in everything his sight went to, he
beheld a token of the island having been recently visited.</p>

<p>“How long’ll it be since you was here, Christian?”
rumbled Reuben, in a note subdued by expectation and
other passions.</p>

<p>“Five month,” answered Christian, hoarsely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>They walked to the margin of the little wood, and
arrived at the source of the stream that ran glittering
and straying like pearls amidst the tall sweet green
grass that grew in the bed of it. Reuben grasped
Christian by the arm.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” he cried.</p>

<p>It was a human skull, and close beside it were the
complete bones of a human skeleton, together with a
little heap of rags. It looked as though the stuff had
been raked together for removal and forgotten.</p>

<p>“That wasn’t how they was left,” exclaimed Christian,
coming to a halt and looking at the bones and rags.
“There’s been a hand arter me here in that job.”</p>

<p>“A boat’s crew may ha’ landed and shovelled the
stuff together out of a sort o’ respect for the remains of
something that might have been a sailor,” exclaimed
Reuben. “Where’s the tree with the hole in it?”</p>

<p>Christian walked to the place where he had been
seated when his eye went to the skeleton aloft.</p>

<p>“That’ll be the tree,” said he.</p>

<p>It was a large tree, the trunk of the bigness of an
English chestnut, but dwarfed in altitude; its beauty
was in the spread and curve of its branches. In the
hinder part of the trunk—speaking with regard to its
bearings from the source of the stream—about five feet
above the ground, was a large hole, partly concealed by
the festooning drapery of the leaves of a rich and
vigorous parasite, which soared in coils to the summit
of the tree. Christian put his hand in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>“Stand by for snakes!” shouted Reuben.</p>

<p>The other drew out a little common brass tobacco-box.</p>

<p>“What’s here?” cried he.</p>

<p>“Try for the jewel box!” exclaimed Reuben.</p>

<p>Christian entered his hand again and felt round.</p>

<p>“There’s nothen more here,” said he.</p>

<p>“Has it fallen to the bottom?”</p>

<p>“There ain’t no hole for it to fall through,” cried
Christian, still feeling. “It’s tight as a locker.”</p>

<p>He looked at the common little brass tobacco-box,
then opened it, and found inside a slip of paper, folded
to the shape of the box, as though in imitation of the
snuff-box document in Christian’s possession. The
handwriting was a bold scrawl in ink. With a
trembling hand and ashen face the poor fellow presented
the paper to his brother, who, putting on his
glasses, read aloud as follows:—</p>

<p>“I would have been glad to take a small share to
help you to find the jewels, but you would not put a
little money in my way, though by interpreting Luis
de Argensola’s dying request in writing I was the
instrument of your discovering that there lay a treasure
to your hand. I therefore arranged with another to
seek for the jewels: the situation being exactly known
to me, because of your ignorance of the Spanish
language, and perhaps of the art of reading, for at the
end of the document, in three lines which it did not
suit my purpose to interpret to you, Don Luis states<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
how the island bears—that, in short, it is between ten
and fifteen miles east of Rum Cay. My friend, I have
found the jewels, and thank you for a fortune. They
consist of pearl and diamond necklaces, brooches,
bracelets, earrings, smelling-bottles, rings, and
diamond ornaments for the hair. I should say they
will not fetch less than £10,000.—Your amigo of
Kingston, <span class="smcap">Pedro</span>.</p>

<p>“I have left the skeletons to your pious care to
coffin and carry to the representative at Villagarcia.
You will find the remains of the Lady Mariana de Mesa
in a cave on the west side of the island.”</p>

<p>The two men burst into a storm of oaths, and the
little wood rang with forecastle and ’longshore imprecations.
When they had exhausted their passions they
knelt and drank from the spring of water, then walked
to the boat, launched her, and returned to the cutter.</p>

<p>They arrived in England safely in due course, but
some time later Reuben was obliged to compound with
his creditors. Christian Hawke died in 1868 on board
ship, still a carpenter.</p>

<h2 id="THE_TRANSPORT_PALESTINE"><i>THE TRANSPORT “PALESTINE.”</i></h2>

<p>In the spring of 1853 the hired transport <i>Palestine</i>,
which had been fitting out at Deptford for the reception
of a number of convicts, was reported to the Admiralty
as ready for sea.</p>

<p>The burthen of the <i>Palestine</i> was 680 tons, and
the number of felons she had been equipped to accommodate
in her ’tween-decks was 120. My name is
John Barker, and I was second mate of that ship.
Her commander was Captain Wickham, and her
chief officer Joseph Barlow. The <i>Palestine</i> was an
old-fashioned craft, scarcely fit for the work she had
been hired for. Official selection, however, was probably
influenced by the owners’ low tender. Good
stout ships got £4 7s. 6d. a ton; I believe the <i>Palestine</i>
was hired for £3 15s.</p>

<p>A guard from Chatham came aboard whilst we were
at Deptford, consisting of a sergeant and ten privates,
under the command of Captain Gordon and Lieutenant
Venables. Shortly afterwards Dr. Saunders, R.N.,
who was going out as surgeon in charge of the
convicts, took up his quarters in the cuddy. On the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
day following the arrival of the doctor and the guard,
we received instructions to proceed to Woolwich and
moor alongside that well-known prison-hulk H.M.S.
<i>Warrior</i>. It was a gloomy, melancholy day; the air
was full of dark vapour, and the broad, grey stream of
the river ran with a gleam of grease betwixt the grimy
shores. A chill wind blew softly, and vessels of all
sorts, to the weak impulse of their wings of brown or
pallid canvas, dulled by the thickness, sneaked soundlessly
by on keels which seemed to ooze through a
breast of soup.</p>

<p>I had often looked at the old <i>Warrior</i> in my coming
and going, but never had I thought her so grimy and
desolate as on this day. A pennant blew languidly
from a pole-mast amidships; she was heaped up
forward into absolute hideousness by box-shaped
structures. Some traces of her old grandeur were
visible in a faded bravery of gilt and carving about
her quarters and huge square of stern, where the
windows of the officials’ cabins glimmered with something
of brightness over the sluggish tremble of
wake which the stream ran to a scope of a dozen
fathoms astern of her rudder. All was silent aboard
her. I looked along the rows of heavily grated ports
which long ago had grinned with artillery, and observed
no signs of life. Indeed, at the time when we moored
alongside, most of the criminals were ashore at their
forced labour, and those who remained in the ship
were caverned deep out of sight hard at work at benches,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
lasts, and the like in the gloomy bowels of the old
giantess.</p>

<p>The <i>Palestine</i> sat like a long-boat beside that towering
fabric of prison hulk. We were no beauty, as I
have said, and the little vessel’s decks were now
rendered distressingly unsightly by strong barricades,
one forward of the foremast, leaving a space betwixt it
and the front of the topgallant forecastle, and the other
a little abaft the mainmast, so as to admit of some area
of quarter-deck between it and the cabin front. Each
barricade was furnished with a gate; the main-hatch
was fortified by oak stanchions thickly studded with
iron nails, the foot of them secured to the lower deck.
This timber arrangement resembled a cage with a
narrow door, through which one man only could pass at
a time. The main-hatch was further protected by a
cover resembling a huge, roofless sentry-box. To this
were attached planks of heavy scantling, forming a
passage which went about ten feet forward; there was
a door at the end of this passage, always guarded by a
sentry with loaded musket and fixed bayonet.</p>

<p>The convicts came aboard at nine o’clock in the
morning following the day of our arrival alongside the
hulk. We were to receive our whole draught of 120
at once from the <i>Warrior</i>, and then proceed. I stood in
the waist and watched the prisoners come over the side.
It was an old-world picture, and the like of it will never
again be seen. The day was as sullen as that which
had gone before; the tall spars and black lines of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
rigging of our ship glistened with dripping moisture.
A guard of six soldiers were drawn up along the front
of the poop commanding the quarter-deck; each bayonet
soared above the motionless shoulder like a thin blue
flame. Captain Gordon and Lieutenant Venables stood
near the men; at the break of the poop, grasping the
brass rail, was Dr. Saunders, scrutinizing the convicts
with a severe, almost scowling face as they arrived.</p>

<p>The unhappy wretches were heavily fettered, and
the long chains attached to the leg-irons clanked with
a strange effect upon the hearing as the heavy tread of
the many feet awoke a low thunder in the hollow deck.
They were marched directly to their quarters in the
’tween-decks. I observed their faces as they passed
through the hatch, and was struck by a general expression
of light-heartedness, as though they were overjoyed at
getting away from the horrors of the prison hulk and
the spirit-breaking labour ashore, with a bright chance
of fortune in the sunny lands beyond the seas to which
the ship was bound.</p>

<p>And certainly the convict in those days was out and
away more tenderly dealt with than were the greater
mass of the poor, honest emigrants. They were well
clothed and better fed than the sailors in the forecastle;
those who were ignorant were taught to read and write;
they were prayed for and eloquently admonished, and
their health was rendered a matter of sincere concern to
both the skipper and the doctor in charge. I recollect
that the felons in our ship were dressed in coarse grey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
jackets and trousers, red stripes in the cloth, Scotch
caps, and grey stockings, and the ship’s number of the
criminal was painted on a square yellow ground on the
arm and back.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the day of embarkation a tug
took us in tow, and we went away down the river on a
straight course for Dungeness, where the steamer cast
us adrift. Until we were clear of soundings I saw
little of the convicts. We met with very heavy weather,
and most of the prisoners lay as sea-sick as young
ladies in their gloomy quarters. I had occasion once in
this time to enter the barracks, as the soldiers’ bulkheaded
compartments were called, where I got a sight
of the convicts in their ’tween-decks. The soldiers slept
under the booby-hatch in cabins rudely knocked up for
their accommodation. Their quarters were divided
from the prison by an immensely strong barricade
bristling with triangular-headed nails, and loopholed
for muskets, so that, in the event of a disturbance,
the soldiers could fire upon the convicts within without
passing the barricade. There was a strong door on
the starboard side of this barricade, at which a
sentinel with a loaded weapon was posted day and
night.</p>

<p>I forget the occasion of my going below. It was
blowing strong, and a high sea was running, the ship
was labouring heavily, and the straining and groaning
of the bulkheads and temporary fastenings were so distracting
that I could easily believe the convicts supposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
the ship was going to pieces. I put my eye to a loophole
in the barricade and saw the picture. Sleeping-shelves
for the reception of six men in a row ran the
length of the ’tween-decks on either hand in two tiers.
There was a suffusion of pale light round about the
main-hatch, but it was like a sulky, thunderous twilight
elsewhere, in the midst of which the shapes of the
prisoners moved or lay motionless as though they were
phantoms beheld in a dream, tragically coloured by
storm, by the cannon-like roar of hurling seas, and the
wild springs and dives of a ship in angry waters. That
scene of ’tween-decks is the most memorable of my life’s
impressions; but I have no words to communicate it.
It was not so much the details of the picture itself—the
pale light under the hatch, the spirit-like figures of the
felons, the lines of glimmering bunks, the bulging bulkheads
of the hospital in the gloomy corner right
forward; it was the deep human meaning that I found
in it—the fancy of the sins, and the conscience, and the
memories, the burning hopes, the biting griefs which
made up the human life contained in that shadowy
timber sea-tossed jail; this it was that gave to the
scene its marvellous impressive significance.</p>

<p>Many of the prisoners were under life sentences;
some were being exiled for fourteen, and some for terms
of seven years. Never a man of them all would
probably see England again. Indeed, it used to be
said that not one in every hundred transported convicts
returned to his native country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>When we got out of the Channel we met with quiet
weather. The prisoners, heavily ironed, were brought
up to help to do the ship’s work and take exercise.
They were put to assist the seamen in washing the
decks down. They were also set to various jobs calculated
to prove useful to themselves. It was a strange
sight to a sailor’s eye to see the convicts in their
barricaded enclosure scrubbing with brushes at the
planks, their chains clanking as they toiled, the burly
boatswain of the ship bawling at the top of his pipes
as he swished the water along, warders (themselves
picked convicts) roaring commands to their fellow-prisoners;
you saw the red coat of a sentry, the gleam
of his bayonet on the forecastle; such another sentry
clasped his musket at the main-hatch, and a third stood
at the gate of the quarter-deck barricade. Overhead
swelled the white sails, lifting to the milky softness of
topgallant-sail and royal; the blue sea flashed in silver
glory under the newly risen sun; smoke blew briskly
away from the chimneys of the convicts’ and the ship’s
cabooses; you saw the cook leaning out of his galley
door watching the scrubbing convicts: aft, on the sand-white
stretch of poop, the captain and the surgeon in
charge of the prisoners would be walking, whilst the
mate of the watch, with one arm circling a backstay,
might be standing at the poop-rail talking to Captain
Gordon or the subaltern, answering questions about the
ship, the names of sails, her rate of progress, or with
long outstretched arm pointing into the dark blue far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
recess to some growing star of canvas, or to some
blackening fibre-like line of steamer’s smoke.</p>

<p>It was not until we had closed the Madeira parallels,
where the weather was hot and the azure slope of billow
winked with the leaps of flying-fish, that the doctor gave
orders for the convicts’ irons to be removed. The whole
of the prisoners were massed on deck and harangued by
him before they were freed. Dr. Saunders had a stern
face; he was a dark-skinned, smooth-shaven man, with
heavy eyebrows and a lowering look, and I thought him
a bully until I had sat a few times at the table when he
was present, and exchanged a few sentences with him
on deck, and then I guessed that he was belied by his
expression of feature and was a good man at root, kind,
and even warm-hearted, though sternly masked for professional
and penitentiary purposes. He addressed the
mass of upturned faces on the quarter-deck, sermonized
them indeed, assured them that it grieved him as much
to hear the clank of their chains as the wearing of the
irons oppressed and degraded them. He begged them
to live on good terms with one another, to guard against
evil language, to love God and keep His Word, and so
to resolve as to assure themselves in the time coming,
in a new land, in the day of their enlargement, of an
honourable and prosperous future. Some listened
doggedly, some as though they would like to laugh out,
some with a little play of emotion in their faces. They
then went below, and their irons were taken off.</p>

<p>Until we reached the latitude of (call it) 5° N.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
all went as things should with us. The convicts were
orderly and seemed well under the control of the doctor.
Every day schools were held above or between decks;
addresses on all sorts of topics were delivered to the
prisoners by the doctor; Divine service was celebrated
three times on Sundays; you’d sometimes hear the
fellows down the hatchways singing psalms of their
own accord. The doctor once at table with a well-pleased
countenance told the captain that one of the
worst of the many ruffians who were being lagged was
now become the most penitent of all the prisoners.</p>

<p>“He talked to me about his past,” Dr. Saunders
said, “with the tears in his eyes, and in a voice broken
by grief. I have great hopes of the poor fellow. Time
was, and not long ago, when I looked upon him as a
Norfolk Islander: I should never be surprised to hear
that he was favoured when out in the colony and was
doing exceedingly well.”</p>

<p>“Is it the square powerfully-built man, pitted with
smallpox, with little black eyes, and a coal-black crop
of hair?” asked Captain Gordon.</p>

<p>The doctor inclined his head.</p>

<p>“His name’s Simon Rolt,” said Lieutenant Venables.
“I was in town at the time of his trial, and, having
plenty of leisure, went one day down to the Old Bailey.
He was convicted——”</p>

<p>Dr. Saunders lifted his hand with an expressive
look. Indeed, it was never his wish that the prisoners
should be named, and he was deaf to all inquiries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
concerning the crimes for which they were being transported.</p>

<p>Well, we had been driven by prosperous winds to the
parallel of 5° N. Here the breeze failed. It was
the zone of equatorial calms, where the dim, hot, blue
water fades out into a near silver faintness of sky, and
where the lofty white canvas of the stagnated ship melts
into the azure brine under her, like quicksilver cloudily
draining through the keel. For the past week the heat
had been fierce; but always had there been a breeze to
fill the windsails and render the roasting atmosphere of
the ’tween-decks endurable. But now, when the wind
was gone, the temperature was scarcely to be supported,
even by the most seasoned of our lobscousers. The
pitch lay like butter in the seams of the planks; the
wheel, flaming its brass-clad circle to the small high
sun, turned red-hot in the grip of the helmsman; the
tar came off the rigging in strings upon the fingers like
treacle, and the hush of the heat lay upon the plain of
ocean as the silence of the white desert dwells upon its
leagues of dazzling sand.</p>

<p>I had charge of the ship during the second dog-watch,
that is, from six to eight. Some little time after
sundown, and when the sky over our mastheads was full
of large, dim, trembling stars, whilst the sea floated
from alongside in a breast of ink into the obscurity of
the horizon, Dr. Saunders approached Captain Gordon,
who was talking to the commander of the ship close to
where I stood, and exclaimed—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>“The heat is too much for the people below. A
hundred and twenty souls in those low-pitched contracted
’tween-decks! The sufferings of slaves in the Middle
Passage can’t be worse.”</p>

<p>“What’s to be done, sir?” said Captain Wickham.
“The wind don’t come to the mariner’s whistle in these
times.”</p>

<p>“We must have detachments of them on deck,”
said Dr. Saunders. “We must let a third of them at
a time breathe the open air and relieve the demands
upon the atmosphere below. It may be done,” he
added, with perhaps the least hint of doubtfulness in
his manner.</p>

<p>Captain Wickham did not speak.</p>

<p>“It ought to be done,” said Lieutenant Venables,
crossing the deck out of the shadow to port with a
lighted cigar in his mouth. “It’s hell, Gordon, in the
barracks.”</p>

<p>“You’ll want the guard to fall in, doctor?” said
Captain Gordon.</p>

<p>“Oh yes, if you please.”</p>

<p>The necessary orders were given; five or six soldiers
mounted the poop ladder, and ranged themselves along
the break, the muskets loaded and the bayonets fixed as
usual. The doctor left the deck, and in some ten
minutes’ time a file of shadowy figures wound, serpent-like,
past the main-hatch sentry into the barricaded
enclosure. They broke into little companies, and all
were as still as the dead; but I could <em>feel</em> in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
postures, in their manner of grouping themselves, the
exquisite relief and delight they found in drinking in the
moist night air.</p>

<p>This detachment remained an hour on deck. When
they went below, and the next lot came up, the time
was half-past eight. I had been relieved at eight bells
by the chief officer; but the heat in the cabin was so
great that after I had stayed a few minutes in my berth
I filled a pipe and went on to the quarter-deck, where I
stood smoking in the recess under the poop. The
quarter-deck barricade was about six feet tall, and the
figures of the convicts behind it were not to be seen
where I stood. Nothing was visible but the stars over
either bulwark-rail, and the festooned cloths of the main
course on high, and the dim square of the becalmed
topsail above it floating up and fading in the darkness
of the night.</p>

<p>All on a sudden an odd, low whistle sounded forward
or aft—I can’t tell where; an instant later the figure
of a convict sprang on to the top of the starboard
bulwarks, where, poising himself whilst you might have
counted ten, he shrieked aloud, “O God, have mercy
upon me! O Christ, have mercy upon me!” and went
overboard.</p>

<p>Silence lasting a moment or two followed the splash;
the hush of amazement and horror was broken by loud
cries from the convicts, sharp orders delivered over my
head in the voice of Captain Gordon, followed by the
tramp of the soldiers striding quick to the break of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
poop clearly to command the people within the barricades
with their muskets. I heard Mr. Barlow, the mate, roar
to the man at the wheel, “Do you see anything of him
there?” And Captain Wickham shouted once or twice,
“Man overboard! Aft, some hands, and clear away
the starboard quarter-boat.” Meanwhile I had observed
the form of Dr. Saunders rush down the poop ladder
and run headlong past the sentry into the barricaded
enclosure, where now at this time his stern, clear voice
rang out strong as he ordered the convicts to fall in and
return to their quarters.</p>

<p>I sprang to the side to look for the man that was
gone, but saw nothing. The sea was like black slush:
there was scarce an undulation in it to flap the softest
echo out of the lightest canvas. I saw no fire in the
water. Something was wrong with the quarter-boat.
They were a long time bungling with the falls, and I
heard the voice of an enraged seaman harshly yell,
“Who the blooming blazes has bin and stopped ’em in
this fashion!”</p>

<p>“Jump for the port boat, men! jump for the port
boat!” shouted Mr. Barlow. “The man’ll have sounded
the bottom whilst you’re messing about with those
tackles.”</p>

<p>I ran on to the poop to lend a hand. The captain,
quickly making me out, told me to get into the boat and
take charge. We were lowered, and rowed away round
the vessel under her counter to look for the man to
starboard, from which side he had jumped. The oars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
as they dipped made no fire in the water. We headed
for the spot whence the convict had sprung, and then
worked our way along the bends and afterwards went
a few strokes astern, and then rowed round to port,
conceiving that the poor devil might have risen on
t’other side the ship.</p>

<p>“Do you see anything of him?” shouted Captain
Wickham.</p>

<p>“Nothing, sir.”</p>

<p>“Hook on! He’s gone—there’s no more to be
done,” called down the captain.</p>

<p>We had spent half an hour in the hunt and the man
was undoubtedly drowned.</p>

<p>Who was the convict that had destroyed himself?
After I had regained the ship, and whilst I was ordering
one of the boat’s crew to go aft and coil away the end
of the starboard main-brace, which I had noticed hanging
over the side, the doctor arrived on the poop, walking
slowly. The guard was by this time dismissed: all was
silent and motionless on the main-deck betwixt the
barricades; the only figures down there were the main-deck
and quarter-deck sentries; but there was much
stir forward upon the forecastle, where the sailors were
stepping from side to side, peering over the rail with
some fancy, no doubt, of catching sight of the floating
body of the drowned convict.</p>

<p>The doctor, Captain Wickham, Captain Gordon, and
the subaltern came together in a group within easy
earshot of where I stood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s the man Simon Rolt,” said the doctor. “I
shall be blamed for allowing the convicts to come on
deck after the regulation hours.”</p>

<p>“Rolt! D’ye mean your religious enthusiast,
doctor?” said Captain Gordon.</p>

<p>“Lucky he was the <em>only</em> one!” exclaimed the commander
of the ship. “Suicide should be contagious in
this heat amongst fellows primed with such memories
as sweeten the sleep of your people.”</p>

<p>“I would rather have lost five hundred pounds than
that it should have happened,” said Dr. Saunders.</p>

<p>“Do the prisoners take it quietly?” inquired Captain
Gordon.</p>

<p>“As I could wish,” answered the doctor. “They
seemed awed and frightened.”</p>

<p>The conversation ran thus for awhile. The party
then went below to drink some grog, and after finishing
my pipe on the quarter-deck I turned in.</p>

<p>I was aroused at midnight to take charge of the ship.
I walked the deck until four, and nothing whatever happened
saving that at about five bells there suddenly
blew a fresh little breeze out of the north-west gloom:
it brightened the stars, and the night felt the cooler for
the mere sound of foam alongside. This breeze was
blowing when I left the deck, and we were then moving
through the water at five knots.</p>

<p>At six o’clock I was awakened by the chief officer
putting his hand upon my shoulder. The look in his
face startled me, and instantly gave me my wits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mr. Barker,” said he, “the captain lies dead in
his bunk. He’s been strangled—garrotted somehow.
Come along with me. Who in the devil’s name done it?”</p>

<p>I sprang out of my bunk and clothed myself quickly.
The morning had fully broken: it was another brilliant
day and the wind gone, and my cabin porthole glowed in
a disc of splendour against the sea under the sun. I
followed the mate to the captain’s cabin. The poor
man lay with his face dark with strangulation: his
features were convulsed and distorted, his eyes were
starting from their sockets, and froth and blood were on
his lips. Dr. Saunders stood beside the body: it seems
that the mate had roused him before coming to me.</p>

<p>“Is he dead, sir?” inquired Mr. Barlow.</p>

<p>“Ay; he has been throttled in his sleep. This
must be the work of one of your crew,” said Dr.
Saunders, speaking low and deliberately, and sending
a professional glance under a frown full of thought and
wonder at the corpse.</p>

<p>“Why one of the crew,” cried Mr. Barlow, “in a
shipload of convicts? With ten soldiers and a sergeant
besides?”</p>

<p>“Convicts!” exclaimed the doctor. “You’ll not
wish me to believe, sir, that the guard is in collusion
with the prisoners? And you’ll have to prove <em>that</em> to
persuade me this is the work of a convict.”</p>

<p>Mr. Barlow retorted; whilst they argued the dreadful
matter I looked about me, but witnessed nothing to
speak to a struggle. Through the large open stern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
window the silver-blue sea was sheeting to the horizon,
and the cabin was full of the light glowing upon the
water. I was very well acquainted with the furniture of
the captain’s cabin, which was right aft on the starboard
side; everything was in its place. The doctor exposed
the throat of the body, and showed us certain livid
marks, which he said signified that the captain had
been killed through compression of the windpipe by a
pair of giant-strong hands. Powerful indeed the murderer
must have been to destroy so vigorous a frame as
Captain Wickham’s in silence, suffocating him as he
lay, with never a sound to penetrate to the adjacent
cabins where Gordon slept and Dr. Saunders and Lieutenant
Venables.</p>

<p>I roused those officers; they viewed the body, and
then the lot of us went into the cuddy, where we held a
council. Dr. Saunders again asserted that the murder
must have been done by one of the sailors—at all events
by some one belonging to the ship. The mate would not
hear of this. Yes, if there was nobody but the ship’s
company in the vessel, then indeed the murderer would
have to be sought for in the forecastle.</p>

<p>Captain Gordon said that he knew his men; he’d
stake his life upon their dutifulness and loyalty.</p>

<p>“If the murderer is one of my people,” said Dr.
Saunders, “he passed the sentry to enter the cuddy.
How was <em>that</em> managed unless the sentry permitted him
to pass?”</p>

<p>“The sentry might have been dozing,” said I.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, sir,” cried Lieutenant Venables, bringing his
fist in a passion on the table; “you are a sailor, Mr.
Barker; you don’t know soldiers.”</p>

<p>“Could the convict have returned to his quarters
unobserved even supposing him to have slipped past
a nodding sentry? A preposterous conjecture!” exclaimed
the doctor. “How would he know where the
captain slept? The murderer is no convict, Gordon.”</p>

<p>It was settled that the mate and I should overhaul
the ship’s company for evidence, whilst the doctor and the
military officers made inquiries for themselves amongst
the prisoners and soldiers. I followed the mate on
deck. He called to the boatswain to pipe all hands.
The whole of the crew assembled on the quarter-deck,
and Mr. Barlow told them that Captain Wickham had
been murdered. He added that the ship must be
searched from end to end, and he called upon the crew
to do their utmost to help me and the boatswain to
ransack the forecastle for evidence.</p>

<p>“I have no fear of the result, my lads,” he exclaimed.
“If the doctor and military officers can clear
the guard and prisoners, so much the better; it is my
duty as your acting commander to see <em>you</em> cleared also,
anyhow, and smartly, too, if you’ll help.”</p>

<p>The men sung out to me to come forward at once;
many were their exclamations charged with the heavy
oaths of the forecastle; and as they rolled forwards I
heard them swearing that if the convicts hadn’t done it
then the murderer was one of the <i>guffies</i> (soldiers).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>Well, the boatswain and I thoroughly searched the
forecastle, but it was a fool’s quest after all; we hardly
knew what to look for. The sailors heartily helped us,
threw open their chests, pulled their hammocks to
pieces, forced us to overhaul their persons, but what
for? It was not as though literally blood had been
shed. There was no knife with damning signs upon the
handle and blade to seek for. The only weapons used
had been the hands. Our search, then, forward was
wholly profitless.</p>

<p>I was an hour in the forecastle, and when I went aft
the doctor and officers were still hard at work questioning
and hunting after evidence below. They came to
Mr. Barlow presently, and told him that they were fully
satisfied the murder had not been the work of a convict.
As to any of the soldiers being concerned—Captain
Gordon indignantly refused to discuss the subject, nay,
to listen to a syllable from us mates on that head.</p>

<p>“Is there nobody missing forward amongst the
crew?” the doctor asked.</p>

<p>“Nobody,” answered Mr. Barlow. “And how does
it stand with <em>your</em> people?”</p>

<p>“Every man jack can be accounted for, of course.”</p>

<p>“Search the ship!” exclaimed Captain Gordon.</p>

<p>“For what?” rejoined the mate. “There’s no man
missing; we’re seven weeks out; what do you expect,
gentlemen, to find hidden below at this time of
day?”</p>

<p>“I’m for searching the ship, nevertheless,” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
Captain Gordon. “Good God! when such a murder as
this has been done, would you stop short just when
discovery may be within reach of another stride?”</p>

<p>The mate, with some colour in his cheek, answered,
“The ship shall be searched.”</p>

<p>I headed one little gang and the boatswain another,
and we thoroughly overhauled the hold from the fore to
the after peak. The ship’s lading consisted of agricultural
implements and light Government commodities
for the colony. Her after-hold was filled with provisions,
barrels of flour, casks of rum, great cases of
tinned meat, and other such things. A large portion of
the steerage, too, under the cuddy was filled with
Government stuff, mattresses, blankets, and so forth,
not to mention three hundred sets of irons.</p>

<p>Our search occupied some time: there was much
ground to cover. Perhaps we did not seek very strenuously.
For my part, I never for a moment imagined
that there would or could be any one not belonging
to the ship in hiding below. Suppose a stowaway:
it would scarcely serve his purpose to make his first
appearance on deck as a murderer, and the murderer of
the captain of the ship of all men! And yet, though I
felt quite certain that the criminal was not amongst our
crew, I was equally sure he was not amongst the
prisoners. One had but to reason a little to understand
that it was not the work of a convict. Every night the
’tween-decks prison gate that gave upon the barracks
was strongly secured. No convict could have made his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
way through it, and beside it was posted the sentry.
Equally well secured and guarded was the main-hatch
entrance. The murderer, then, was not a convict. Was
he a soldier?</p>

<p>We buried the body of the captain that morning, and
Mr. Barlow took command of the ship. When night
came a sentry was posted at the cuddy door (this was in
addition to the usual guard), and the sergeant received
instructions to make the rounds of the cuddy from time
to time to see that all was well. In this work he would
be assisted by the mate of the watch and by the ship’s
boatswain, who would now serve as second mate.</p>

<p>The night passed quietly. From time to time
Captain Gordon or Lieutenant Venables illustrated his
restlessness by coming on deck and flitting about, calling
to the cuddy-door sentry and asking me questions.
This was during my watch, during the silent passages
of which I deeply pondered the matter of the murder,
but could make nothing of it. Had it been done by
some one walking in his sleep? Some one of us who,
utterly unconscious of his deed, had viewed the corpse
of the strangled captain with horror and astonishment?</p>

<p>I turned in at four, leaving the ship in the hands of
the boatswain, and when I came on deck at eight I
found a fresh breeze blowing off the beam, a wide scene
of dark blue sea running in lines of froth, and the bluff
bows of the <i>Palestine</i> bursting in thunder through the
surge and driving the foam before her beyond the flying-jibboom
end. The brightness of the day, the beauty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
of the scene, the swift dance of the old hooker, put some
heart into all of us who lived aft. Yet we could talk of
nothing but the murder. I suggested somnambulism;
the doctor listened to me with a dark smile, then walked
away. Mr. Barlow said that sooner or later we should
find out that one of the soldiers had done it. In the
course of the day Captain Gordon and Dr. Saunders
went below, where they stayed long, questioning closely.
I was on deck at dinner-time, and heard Mr. Barlow
warmly defending himself against the accusation of the
two military men, who, as I gathered, had declared that
he exhibited an indifference and seemed to fail in his
duty by neglecting to push his investigations to further
lengths in the forecastle. This talk made me feel very
hot; but Mr. Barlow was well able to take care of himself,
and wound up a highly-flavoured protest against
Captain Gordon’s observations by asserting that his own
suspicions strongly pointed to the soldiers.</p>

<p>Well, the precautions of the previous night were
renewed on this; the cuddy door was guarded, and from
time to time one or another made the rounds of the
cabins. I had the morning watch, that is, from four
till eight. The hour was about half-past six. The
watch was busy in washing down the forecastle and fore-deck,
and a number of convicts were scrubbing at the
planks in the prison enclosure. I stood at the brass rail
watching a picture that was full of life and colour. A
light breeze followed us; the sea was a delicate blue, and
rolled in flowing folds, and the sails sank like breathing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
beasts to the curtsying of the ship upon the swell.
It was fiery hot, and the sunshine came tingling off its
own reflection in the sea like clouds of flaming needles.</p>

<p>I turned, and found the ship’s steward at my elbow.
His face was as white as veal. I never could have
imagined the countenance capable of such an expression
of horror as his carried. His mouth was dry, and he
mumbled, without articulation, and put out his hand, as
though feeling for something in the air.</p>

<p>“Oh, sir!”</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“Dr. Saunders——”</p>

<p>“What of him? What of him?”</p>

<p>“Murdered, sir! His throat cut. God have mercy,
it’s a sight that’s going to last me for ever!”</p>

<p>For some moments I stood motionless, idly and
mechanically exclaiming, “Dr. Saunders murdered
Dr. Saunders murdered!” Then, calling to one of
the best seamen in my watch, I bade him look after
the ship whilst I ran below, and the steward followed
me down the companion ladder.</p>

<p>I went straight to the doctor’s berth. It was next
Captain Gordon’s, on the starboard side. The steward,
in his fright and flight, had left the door open, and I
had no need to enter the berth to witness the dreadful
spectacle.</p>

<p>“Murder!” suddenly screamed the steward at my
elbow, in some hysteric paroxysm of horror. “Who’s
doing it? who’s doing it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>His loud cries awakened the sleepers round about;
in a moment Captain Gordon, Lieutenant Venables, and
Mr. Barlow rushed out of their cabins. The group of
us entered the cabin of the slaughtered man and looked
at the corpse, and then stood staring at one another.
The head was half severed; under the bunk the cabin
floor was black with blood; but, as in the case of the
murder of the captain, so now—everything was in its
place.</p>

<p>We went into the cuddy, closing the door upon the
murdered man. It was scarcely to be realized that <em>he</em>
had fallen a victim. One somehow felt the terror in it
more strongly than in the assassination of the commander
of the ship, though, to be sure, as captain, his
had been out and away the more valuable life.</p>

<p>“Venables,” cried Captain Gordon, “tell the sergeant
to fall in the guard at once. Mr. Barlow—do not
think I wish to dictate—will not you be acting wisely
in summoning the whole of the ship’s company aft,
acquainting them with this second crime, and making
them understand that whilst the villain who has done
these things remains undiscovered, no man’s life is safe
aboard this vessel?”</p>

<p>Mr. Barlow simply bowed, but in a manner that let
Captain Gordon know his wishes would be complied
with; I followed him on deck, he was deathly white and
dreadfully agitated and horror-stricken. I spoke to
him; he stared wildly at me and merely cried, “Who
is it that’s doing it? Who is it that’s doing it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>But already the news of this second murder had
gone forward; no need for the boatswain to sound his
whistle; all hands were on deck, and they came
tumbling aft with scared looks to the first cry I raised.
The guard had assembled on the poop, but when the
mate and I came on deck the last of the convicts who
had been helping to wash down was passing through
the boarded gangway into the hatch, with the subaltern
waiting to see him disappear. The three sentries,
forward and amidships, stood motionless, the bright
lines of their bayonets close against their cheeks.</p>

<p>By this time the mate had collected his mind; he
addressed the crew with passion and in strong language,
told them what had happened, swore that no man’s life
was safe, and exhorted them as Englishmen to work
like fiends to discover the assassin if he was one of them.</p>

<p>“Whoever the murderer is, he don’t sling his
hammock in our fo’k’s’le,” shouted a sailor.</p>

<p>Another bawled, “We’ll do everything that’s right,
sir, but don’t let the guffies reckon that there’s any
bloody cut-throats amongst <em>us</em>.”</p>

<p>“Look for your man in the ’tween-decks,” shouted
a third.</p>

<p>A whole volley of this sort of thing was fired off by
the crew. Captain Gordon spoke to them quietly,
and then turned to his own men; his manner was
gentlemanly and dignified. The full spirit of the
British officer was expressed in him as he stood speaking,
with one hand grasping the brass rail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>This time the murder was one of real bloodshed;
there should be a clue, therefore, to hunt after, were it
but a fragment of stained apparel, or an unowned knife
with marks of human butchery upon it. The sailors
roared to me to follow them forward and watch them
overhaul their forecastle. But nothing came of it. As
before, every chest, every bunk, every hammock was
ransacked, and now the seamen handled one another’s
clothes. But it was all to no purpose, and I came out
of the forecastle hot as fire and sick at heart, and went
aft with my report to Mr. Barlow.</p>

<p>They had not been idle at the cuddy end of the ship.
It was owing to the suggestion of Lieutenant Venables
that two convicts, who had been thief-takers in their
day, hounds of justice, afterwards cast, the one for
housebreaking, the other for “smashing:” it was
owing to the subaltern that these two men were brought
out of the prisoners’ quarters and put to the task
(guarded by a couple of soldiers) of discovering the
murderer. One was a thick-set, beetle-browed man,
the other slim, with a cast eye and a fixed leering smile.
They spent the whole day in this hunt. They searched
every cabin aft, questioned the soldiers who had been on
sentry duty at the cuddy door during the night, explored
every box, locker, whatever was to be met with in that
way. They tumbled my clothes about in my cabin and
obliged me to undress myself; but then they served
Gordon, Venables, and Barlow so. They swore the
murders were not the work of a convict; indeed, it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
perfectly certain no prisoner could by any possibility
break out of the ’tween-decks during the night when the
gates were secured and the sentries posted.</p>

<p>The two convict-searchers then went to the forecastle,
but the Jacks there, on learning the object of the
fellows’ visit, said that no blooming oakum-pickers
would be allowed to pass through the forescuttle; they
had overhauled one another and all that their sea-parlour
contained, and the second officer who had
looked on had gone away satisfied; and a powerful
sailor acting as the crews’ spokesman swore with a huge
oath that if the two prisoners attempted to enter the
forecastle the men would lash them back to back and
heave them overboard.</p>

<p>Captain Gordon asked that the hold should be again
thoroughly searched. I put in at this, and said the
boatswain and I and others had overhauled the ship’s
inside from fore to after peak.</p>

<p>“No good in walking round and round a job,”
exclaimed Mr. Barlow. “What’s been done <em>is</em> done,
gentlemen. There’s no murderer under hatches. How’s
he to come up unseen? The cuddy-door sentry guards
the steerage-hatch; the main-hatch and forecastle are
watched by your men.”</p>

<p>There was nothing more to be done. The body of
the doctor was dropped over the side, and it was now
for Captain Gordon and the subaltern to see after the
prisoners. A feeling of consternation took possession of
us all. Every man looked at his fellows with more or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
less of distrust. Who was to be the next victim, and
who was the fiend that was doing these murders?
Where did he lurk? Which of all the people you saw
moving about the ship as soldiers, sailors, prisoners
was he? And what was his object?</p>

<p>The arms chest was brought into the cuddy, and the
four of us who now occupied the after part of the vessel
slept with loaded weapons at our side, and every half-hour
during the night, at the sound of the bell, the cry,
“All’s well!” went from sentinel to sentinel, and
regularly at every hour an armed soldier, and one of the
seamen under the eye of the mate of the watch—whether
the boatswain or myself—went the rounds of the cuddy,
pausing, listening, looking into the cabins to see that
all was right.</p>

<p>This was precaution enough, you might think, with
the addition of a cuddy-door sentry urged into exquisite
vigilance by stern instructions and by fears for his own
throat.</p>

<p>Well, after the doctor was found murdered, ten days
passed, and nothing in any way to alarm us happened.
In this time we sneaked across the equator, and our
taut bowlines snatched some life for the ship out of a
dead-on-end southerly breeze, with a short, staggering
roll of foaming blue water and a heavy westerly swell.
It fell out, by the revolution of the watches, that I took
charge of the deck on this tenth day from eight o’clock
till midnight. The military officers turned in at eleven.
Mr. Barlow stayed to yarn with me, and our talk was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
mainly about the two murders, and I noticed that the
mate still seemed to believe that it was the work of a
soldier. He went below whilst some one was striking
five bells—half-past eleven. I watched him pass under
the skylight; he stood a moment or two looking up at
the lamp as though he thought the dim flame should be
further dimmed, then drank a glass of water and passed
out of sight.</p>

<p>The boatswain relieved me at eight bells. I gave
him the course and certain instructions, and specially
exhorted him to see that the round of the cuddy was
punctually made. I went to my cabin by way of the
quarter-deck; a sentry stood posted, as usual, at the
cuddy door, and I could dimly discern the figure of a
second soldier at the main-hatch. My cabin was
immediately abreast of the one that had been occupied
by Dr. Saunders. Before lying down I looked to the
brace of pistols we all of us aft now slept with, and then,
as heretofore, peeped under the bunk, and took a careful
squint round about....</p>

<p>I was startled into instant broad wakefulness by a
heavy groan, the report of a musket, and a sharp savage
cry as of a man cursing whilst he stabs and slays
another. The report of the musket in the resonant
interior of the little cuddy sounded like the explosion of
a magazine. I rushed out in trousers and shirt,
grasping one of the pistols; but I was not the first.
Captain Gordon and Lieutenant Venables were before
me; Mr. Barlow sprang through his cabin door as I ran<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
through mine; the boatswain was also tumbling down
the companion steps, and I heard the noise of the feet
of the watch racing aft along the deck, and exclamations
of the soldiers coming through the booby-hatch.</p>

<p>The figure of a man lay upon the cuddy floor
between the table and the steerage hatchway, and
beside him stood a sentry in the act of wrenching his
bayonet out of the prostrate body. I turned up the
lamp; the cuddy was fast filling. There was a universal
growling and crying of questions.</p>

<p>“See to the prisoners, Venables!” I heard Captain
Gordon say, and the subaltern shoved through the
crowd to the door, calling for the guard.</p>

<p>“Turn him over. Who is it?” exclaimed Mr. Barlow.</p>

<p>I drew close to the motionless man on deck. Meanwhile
the soldier who had killed him was standing at
attention with his eyes fixed on Captain Gordon, and
the bayonet in his musket dripping red in the lamplight.
A couple of seamen turned the body—it had fallen
sideways to the thrust of the steel, with its face upon deck.</p>

<p>“Stand out of the light!” cried Mr. Barlow.</p>

<p>“Great heavens!” exclaimed Captain Gordon; “it’s
the prisoner Simon Rolt!”</p>

<p><em>Simon Rolt!</em> There before us on the deck, dead,
with the thrust of a bayonet through his heart, with a
long, gleaming sheath-knife firmly grasped in his right
hand, lay the corpse of the man who had fallen overboard—whom
we all supposed lay drowned at the bottom of
the sea weeks ago—whom we had all as utterly forgotten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
as though his memory had been no more than one of
the bubbles which had floated to the surface with his
plunge! We could not credit the evidence of our sight.
Then, indeed, the suspicion of some enormous scheme
of treachery as concerned the convicts seemed to visit
all in that cabin assembled, as though we had been
one man.</p>

<p>“He’ll have had a confederate,” shouted a voice.</p>

<p>“He was for murdering the officers, and then the
convicts ’ud have rose and killed all hands,” bawled
another with lungs of storm.</p>

<p>“Silence!” cried Captain Gordon, and he questioned
the sentry, who, standing bolt upright in a cool, collected
way, told this story. Having crossed the deck, leaving
the cabin door on his left, he happened to glance through
the window into the interior, and saw what he supposed
was a shadow cast by the dimly-burning lamp upon the
head of the steerage steps. He shrank and put himself
out of sight of it, though commanding it still, and
presently he saw it stir and scrawl into the shape of
a human head and shoulders. The sneaking subtle
bulk rose clear of the steps, and noiselessly as the
shadow of a cloud it was creeping aft into the gloom
under the table when the sentry swiftly stepped into
the door and challenged it. Up sprang the man: in
a few beats of the heart his long knife would have been
through the soldier; but the redcoat was too quick for
him: the bayonet pierced the devil’s breast, and at the
same moment the musket, which the soldier had cocked,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
exploded. The convict fell dead with a single groan, but
the soldier in his rage stabbed him thrice to make sure
of him, cursing him loudly as he drove the steel home.</p>

<p>Some seamen picked up the body and put it away
in one of the cabins. The cuddy was then cleared and
a wet swab brought along to cleanse the deck; but
until dawn the sailors stood about in the waist and
gangways talking. A quiet wind held the canvas
motionless, and the ship stole softly through the shadow
of the darkest hours of the night. Mr. Barlow told me
that when daybreak came I must go into the hold and
find out where the villain had hidden himself. The
military men and the mate and I lingered in the cuddy
in conversation.</p>

<p>“Was it Rolt himself who jumped overboard, or
was the figure some dummy?” said Captain Gordon,
who immediately added, “Oh, it must have been the
convict. How could he have got aft?”</p>

<p>“I saw him jump. Many must have seen him,”
said I.</p>

<p>“How did he get on board?” exclaimed Lieutenant
Venables.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what’s in my head, gentlemen,” said
I. “I’ve been turning the matter over; you’ll find I’m
right, I believe. There was the end of the main-brace
hanging over the quarter. I took notice of it as we
pulled under the ship’s stern. That brace was taken off
its pin and lowered by a confederate hand. I heard a low
whistle sound through the ship before the man sprang.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>“So did I,” said Captain Gordon. “You’ll remember,
Venables, I asked you if you heard it?”</p>

<p>“We’ll find out who was at the wheel that night
when the man jumped overboard,” exclaimed the mate.</p>

<p>“Pray go on with your notions, Mr. Barker,” said
Captain Gordon. “I fancy you’ve hit the truth.”</p>

<p>“Why,” I continued, “suppose the thing preconcerted,
and Rolt with a confederate amongst the crew;
the whistle signalled all ready for the jump; a few
silent strokes would bring the convict to the end of the
main-brace, and the rest signified merely a hand-over-hand
climb, with the mizzen-chains as a black hiding-place
till the ship was silent. I take it that the man
got round into the captain’s cabin window; he found
it open, entered, and strangled the commander, who
probably started up on the villain entering.”</p>

<p>“That’ll be it certainly, gentlemen,” said Mr. Barlow,
looking from one to another of the officers. “The
convict,” he continued, “found the cuddy empty, and
made his way into the steerage. But he would need a
plan of the ship in his head to hide himself. Who’s
the scoundrel amongst the crew that helped him?”</p>

<p>At daybreak the boatswain and I went below into
the steerage. We found the after-peak hatch-cover off,
whence it was clear that the man had hidden in that
part of the ship. We again thoroughly examined the
hold, but we could not imagine how and where the man
had secreted his square powerful form so as to completely
baffle our first search. We found a large cask<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
about a quarter full of ship’s bread. The head was off
and lying near. The boatswain thought that the convict
might have concealed himself in that cask, heading
himself up in it; and to prove that this could be done
he got in, holding the head, which he put on when he
was inside. If this cask had been the convict’s hiding-place
it is certain in our first search none of us had
meddled with it, or beyond doubt we should have discovered
him.</p>

<p>And now to end this strange yarn. Mr. Barlow
found out that a seaman named Mogg was at the wheel
on the night Rolt jumped overboard. The mate and I—indeed,
all of us aft—were persuaded that whoever
stood at the wheel at that time was the convict’s confederate,
because the main-brace must have been dropped
into the sea and belayed by some one, who, standing
near, could fling the rope overboard swiftly over the
side without being observed. Certainly the brace had
not been long overboard when the whistle sounded; Mr.
Barlow or myself would have noticed it, wondered at
such an unusual piece of lubberliness, and ordered the
thing to be hauled in and coiled down.</p>

<p>However, that Mogg was Rolt’s confederate was
made almost certain a little later on when some of the
crew came to Mr. Barlow and me to say they had
heard Mogg speak of Rolt as his cousin. He was put
into irons, but was dumb for a month, then, swearing
that the memory of the murders lay as heavy on his
soul as though he had committed them, he confessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
that he had agreed with Rolt to help him to escape and
hide in the after part of the ship, of which he gave him
a plan. They had twenty different schemes. One had
been this of the convict’s jumping overboard when
Mogg was at the wheel and the main-brace over the
side. The opportunity they awaited came with several
marvellous conditions for successful execution of the
stratagem when the doctor on a breathless night brought
the prisoners up in batches to breathe. Mogg said he
had passed Rolt on his way to the wheel, and settled
everything in a few whispers, and the signal was to be
a long, low whistle. It was then he had given him the
knife out of his sheath. The intention of the convict,
as we gathered from Mogg, was to kill all the officers
but myself; I was to be left to navigate the ship. He
and Mogg reckoned that when the crew and the soldiers
found themselves without commanders they would
become demoralized, and allow the convicts to seize
the ship. The seaman denied that he had tampered
with the falls of the starboard quarter-boat.</p>

<p>We handed Mogg over to the police on our arrival,
and they sent him in a ship sailing immediately to
take his trial in England.</p>
